My name is Yuliya. Just Yuliya. But in our old internet I'm more known as **aviskase.** By that nickname you can find me nearly everywhere. And my surname is badass: Bagriy. You can pronoune it as "Bug-ray". Yay!

I am a test guy. Not a tester, not a QA, not a "test engineer", just plain test guy. A test guy sounds pretty and unassuming. 


## P.S.
If you notice some problems here (mistakes or worse), just write me on <a href="mailto:aviskase@gmail.com">aviskase@gmail.com</a>.
