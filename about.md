My name is Yuliya. Just Yuliya. But in our old internet I'm more known as **aviskase.** By that nickname you can find me nearly everywhere. And my surname is badass: Bagriy. You can pronounce it as "Bug-ray". Yay!

I am a test guy. Not a tester, not a QA, not a "test engineer", just a plain test guy. A test guy sounds pretty and unassuming.
