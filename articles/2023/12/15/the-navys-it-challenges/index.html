But for me it sounds bizarrely specific. So, here some of my musings about it.</p><p>Those problems with internal communications. It got me curious, how really it&rsquo;s even done in the military. &ldquo;Army-wide&rdquo; emails? Slack, Zoom, Teams? IRC? The answer is <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianForces/comments/11hy76u/scs_whaaaatsappp/ class=external-link>all of these</a>. Total chaos. I especially like the comment mentioning using Facebook Messenger, because, c&rsquo;mon! At least, no WeChat. I hope. I also hope they have less problems accessing their Top Secret Network stuff, <a href=https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/di-id/documents/rpt/rapporteur/Independent-Special-Rapporteur%20-Report-eng.pdf class=external-link>not like our ministers [page 27]</a>.</p><p>While we already established that, in fact, it&rsquo;s way easier to just publicly share YouTube video than send a file or a private link, I highly doubt it was the main reason. Thus, I wonder, why IT was selected as a pretext. Why. Is it something on admiral&rsquo;s mind? Or is it a common &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; that always gets blamed and everyone nods understandingly? Is IT a dog that ate the homework in government offices? &#x1f644;</p><hr><p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m back. Kinda. No promises.</p></article><div class=article-nav><span class=article-nav-old><a href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2021/09/06/using-openapi-cli-custom-rules/ title="Using openapi-cli: custom rules"><span class=arrow>◁</span>older</a>
