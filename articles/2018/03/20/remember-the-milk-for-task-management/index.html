First, with free account, later with Pro. And it&rsquo;s a <em>second</em> time I won a Pro :) RTM is great. For me, four killer features are:</p><ul><li>Start dates and due dates</li><li>Very customizable repeat options</li><li>Really smart add syntax (you can input everything as one-liner and all task fields will be populated)</li><li>Smart lists (basically, it&rsquo;s saved searches with operators like <code>tag:</code> and logic control with <code>AND</code>/<code>OR</code>/<code>NOT</code>/parentheses)</li></ul><p>You can implement any imaginable task management system with it. I use <a href=http://blog.rememberthemilk.com/post/172085635648/tips-tricks-tuesday-combining-organization class=external>a setup based on M.Â Dorofeev&rsquo;s approach</a>. Of course, specialized apps are probably a bit easier if you strictly follow rules of one &ldquo;true&rdquo; system, but with RTM you can do the heck you want any time you want. There is a bizarre development fashion to &ldquo;box&rdquo; users with constraints, to give no options. And for me RTM is a breeze of sane air of freedom.</p><div class="page-navigation code"><a class=prev href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2018/03/19/mega-mind-map-version-2/ title="Mega Mind Map: Version #2">&larr; older</a>
