I was a tester once. Then, API developer/advocate/whatever. Shortly after my previous maternity leave, our company was acquired (again) and I had to do even more pure developer work. React, of all the things! Not a fan. So, that was the first time I had a thought about switching to something less developer-ish.</p><p>Second, since 2022 I&rsquo;ve picked up a bunch of peculiar interests, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27wWRszlZWU" class=external-link>Canadian defense procurement shenanigans</a>. Or knowing that CAF does cyber something under hunt-forward operations REASSURANCE (Latvia) and UNIFIER (Ukraine). Yeah, my LinkedIn sponsored job ads look weird now.</p><p>Third, after our office was layed off, I took a look at the job market and it wasn&rsquo;t that inspiring. Meh. I should (and could) have started way earlier though, but it hit me only now. Specifically, I was hit by CTU MOOC in <a href=https://buttondown.com/grugq/archive/ class=external-link>the grugq&rsquo;s newsletter</a>. Learning that the local community isn&rsquo;t one and a half anonymous sad person but very very active and huge was an additional boost.</p><p>At this moment I haven&rsquo;t even decided yet at what path to take: pentesting (nod to my testing time) or security engineer (nod to the developer time). For sure not SOC, even though it is probably an easier position to find. But I have time. Though, I recall being brain-dead for a year last time I had a baby, so, that&rsquo;s gonna be a really funny experience.</p></article><div class=article-nav><span class=article-nav-old><a href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2024/03/16/goodbye-ogimage/ title="Goodbye, og:image"><span class=arrow>◁</span>older</a>
