The successful pilot involved multiple banks and clients, setting the stage for a transparent and competitive financial sector by 2024.</p></blockquote><p>Cool. Let&rsquo;s read the report.</p><blockquote><p>The pilot project was carried out with the participation of focus groups of 128 clients and second-tier banks, including Bank RBK, Altyn Bank, Home Credit Bank, Bank CenterCredit, and Otbasy Bank.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The country now follows the concept of development of Open API and Open Banking for 2023-2025, which was approved by the National Bank of Kazakhstan, the Agency for Regulation and Development of Financial Market, and the Agency for Protection and Development of Competition in December 2022.</p></blockquote><p>Yup, Halyk Bank isn&rsquo;t mentioned, so it&rsquo;s just a really early pilot. Even more, no Kaspi Bank. It&rsquo;s like doing something in Canada without involving <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_banks_of_Canada class=external-link>Big Five</a>. Well, they have 2 more years, so, good luck.</p><p>Hmm. Speaking of. What about Canada?</p><p>Despite Canada&rsquo;s reputation for bad information disclosure approaches, I do enjoy the content available on <code>canada.ca</code>. Including <a href=https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/banking/open-banking.html class=external-link>what&rsquo;s up with open banking</a>. It&rsquo;s a long page, but all you need is the first sentence:</p><blockquote><p>Open banking, also called consumer-driven banking, is not yet available in Canada.</p></blockquote><p>Ouch. Is there any progress, though? According to <a href=https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/financial-sector-policy/open-banking-implementation/2023-fes-policy-statement-consumer-driven-banking.html class=external-link>2023 Fall Economic Statement: Policy Statement on Consumer-Driven Banking</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The Department of Finance will advance the work required to stand up a Canadian framework governing consumer-driven banking, with the goal of adopting legislation and fully implementing the necessary governance framework by 2025.</p></blockquote><p>Same year, different goals. Kazakhstan is planning to finish implementing (doubt it), whereas Canada is planning to finish with laws and paperwork (doubt it too). Let&rsquo;s put a reminder and check on them both in 2025?</p></article><div class=article-nav><span class=article-nav-old><a href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2023/12/15/the-navys-it-challenges/ title="The Navy’s IT challenges"><span class=arrow>◁</span>older</a>
