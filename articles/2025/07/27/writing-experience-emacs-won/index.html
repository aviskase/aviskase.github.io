I&rsquo;m a tech person. I knew about Emacs. But I had never tried it. It has a kind of mythical aura around it, something you&rsquo;d feel intimidated to touch. So I didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>I am also well aware of the editor wars with vim. This one I use sometimes. You don&rsquo;t really have a choice. Lots of people praise it so much and use vim bindings everywhere else. Thus, I made several attempts at learning more than just a couple of keys, yet it never stuck with me. Bleh.</p><p>A month ago, I had to decide which subscription services to continue using. And painfully, I chose not to renew <a href=https://amazingmarvin.com/ class=external-link>Amazing Marvin</a>. I love it! I wish all the best to the team (Christina, Mark, Branko); you&rsquo;re great people doing impressive work. But I needed to go. First, I checked the usual alternatives: Remember The Milk, TickTick, Todoist. Nope, nope, and meh.</p><p>So, I continued my research. Obscure services, self-hosted options. While nap trapped, I stumbled upon <a href=https://www.orgzlyrevived.com/ class=external-link>Orgzly</a> in f-droid and learned that it supports:</p><ul><li>different task states: TODO, NEXT, BLOCKED, DONE, CANCELLED, whatever you desire</li><li>separate schedule and due dates</li><li><em>three</em> repeating patterns: every, after, catch-up (the best pattern ever)</li><li>nested tasks / projects</li><li>pretty good filtering (though not perfect)</li></ul><p>Huh. This was exactly what I needed. So, I thought, OK, let&rsquo;s try the legendary org-mode.</p><p>Fast forward two weeks, and I&rsquo;m writing this post to say how thrilled I am. Emacs is surprisingly noob user friendly. I am not forced to be a keyboard warrior when I just want to sit back and poke with my mouse. Or I&rsquo;m nap trapped.</p><p>And when I want to use a keyboard fully, it feels like spell-casting. I&rsquo;m mesmerized by Emacs magic incantations. Some say that all the Ctrl&rsquo;s, Meta&rsquo;s, and Shift&rsquo;s are annoying, whereas I find them natural and flowing compared to jumping back and forth between vim modes.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve just started. My config is almost empty: I follow <a href=https://www.masteringemacs.org/ class=external-link>Mastering Emacs</a> advice to learn the vanilla thing first. And there are of course some frustrations:</p><ul><li>The documentation is extensive, yet some parts require deep reading to understand. Skimming through doesn&rsquo;t work (me struggling with <a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Version-Control.html class=external-link>version control docs</a>; <a href=https://magit.vc/ class=external-link>magit docs</a> aren&rsquo;t better).</li><li>Haven&rsquo;t got to this yet, but I write in Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Apparently, it&rsquo;s preferable to use Emacs internal language control instead of the system&rsquo;s one. So I&rsquo;ll have to rework my hand memory and <a href=https://github.com/dunmaksim/emacs-russian-techwriter-input-method class=external-link>research good configs</a>.</li><li>Windows and buffers are unpredictable on the surface. In what window a help or a vc buffer appears still surprises me, which is annoying.</li><li>So. Much. To. Learn. It&rsquo;s a blessing and a curse, I need to make a conscious decision not to chase yet another shiny feature to actually finish the tasks at hand.</li></ul><p>Emacs is a big brain and time investment. I&rsquo;m amazed enough to pursue it, yet I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it to everyone. For now, I&rsquo;ll continue using Obsidian for PKM because the mobile app is just easier. There is an Emacs for Android and <a href=https://orgro.org/ class=external-link>Orgro</a>, alas, they can&rsquo;t compete. I recall <a href=https://logseq.com/ class=external-link>Logseq</a> supporting org files, but AFAIK it was too restrictive with the structure and I didn&rsquo;t like the overall UX. Also <a href=https://karl-voit.at/2024/01/28/logseq-from-org-pov/ class=external-link>Karl Voit mentions org support is gonna go anyway</a>.</p><p>So, at the moment I mostly use org-mode as a task manager and a calendar. And I use Emacs for my <a href=https://cooklang.org/ class=external-link>cooklang</a> recipe collection. It ain&rsquo;t much, but it&rsquo;s an honest start, right? :)</p></article><nav class=article-nav aria-label="Post navigation"><span class=article-nav-old><a href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2025/05/02/writeup-tryhackme-w1seguy/ title="Writeup: TryHackMe W1seGuy" aria-label="Go to older post"><span class=arrow>‚óÅ</span>older</a>
