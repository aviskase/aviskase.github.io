What happened this year:

My title switched from &ldquo;tester&rdquo; to &ldquo;engineer&rdquo;. Yay?
Had a great time at ASC 2020 conference. Yes, it&rsquo;s not my first conference, but this one left a good long-lasting aftertaste.
I ported blog from pelican to hugo and started a redesign. Still much to do and polish, but at least the base is sound.
Joined Obsidian community.
As a consequence, I unwillingly created a YouTube channel in Russian. It&rsquo;s cool to learn new skills (audio cleaning, video editing), but to be honest, content creation in Russian isn&rsquo;t exactly a lucrative or professionally valuable hobby. Still, I cannot say no to people asking to teach or explain something: knowledge sharing is one of the biggest values to me.
Finished Finnish tree on Duolingo. Don&rsquo;t ask why, I, person living in Quebec, learn Finnish. I just want to! Se on täydellinen kieli.

Concentrate more on tutorials.</li><li>Guitar. Must. Be. Conquered. To make the promise more realistic, I hereby vow to start daily lessons as soon as I finish levelling <a href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/02/01/hmms-january/#gaming class=internal-link>my main in ESO to CP 810</a> (yup, I&rsquo;m still playing it).</li><li>Begin drawing lessons in the 2nd half of the year.

Typical end-of-year posts often contain promises to read more or learn new professional skills/tools. But my to-read/to-watch/to-learn queue is on the opposite side: it must be scaled down occasionally; I&rsquo;m definitely not one of those people who seems to have an endless fountain of energy to do everything (aksi, talking about ya here).</p><h2 id=advent-of-code><a href=#advent-of-code>Advent of code</a></h2><p>This was the first time I did <a href=https://adventofcode.com/ class=external-link>Advent of code</a> with the devs from work: nice to compare with normal people and not <em>reddit stars</em>. Cannot express how happy I&rsquo;m to be <a href=https://github.com/aviskase/advent-of-code/tree/master/2020 class=external-link>back to Python</a>, it&rsquo;s so readable and clear after JS/TS madness.</p><p><figure><picture><source srcset=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/12/30/hmms-2020/aoc_hu_85d3b8f2d942191e.webp type=image/webp><img src=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/12/30/hmms-2020/aoc.png alt="Advent of Code easter egg: using itertools" defer></picture></figure></p></article><div class=article-nav><span class=article-nav-old><a href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/12/20/using-openapi-cli-intro/ title="Using openapi-cli: intro"><span class=arrow>◁</span>older</a>
