<a href=https://wiki.c2.com/?OrdersOfIgnorance class=external-link>order of ignorance</a> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;. And as I&rsquo;m wearing an
API designer hat more and more, learning about broader architectural stuff is essential.</p><p>Another &ldquo;merging the trenches&rdquo; experience was
<a href=https://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev/design-dev/intentional-api-consumer-experience/ class=external-link>an article about using user types and personas for API design</a>.
Personas are a nifty tool for any team, but for me, it&rsquo;s been difficult to apply them consistently.
This is something I still need to learn and practice.</p><p><em>In these uncertain times, uncertainty is certain ©.</em> Right before the quarantine, I ordered a book
<a href=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920201755.do class=external-link>Continuous API Management</a>. Well, it arrived. Today. On the
serious note, I&rsquo;m happy to start reading it, though I could have it finished in e-book format
while waiting xD</p><p>And a small off-topic, my other purchase this month was a drawing tablet
<a href=https://www.huion.com/pen_tablet/Inspiroy/H640P.html class=external-link>Huion H640P</a>. The good thing about it is that there are
proper drivers for Linux. And it&rsquo;s cheap =) Bad thing is that I&rsquo;ve just upgraded to Ubuntu 20.04 with 5.4 kernel
that is buggy and prevents these drivers from being installed. Oopsie. So, I&rsquo;m waiting until 5.6 kernel is stable
enough or 5.4 is fixed to fully dive into e-drawing. At the very least I&rsquo;d like to draw doodles and diagrams with it,
and maybe, MAYBE, actually learn to draw.</p></article><div class=article-nav><span class=article-nav-old><a href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/05/02/hmms-april/ title="Hmms: April"><span class=arrow>◁</span>older</a>
