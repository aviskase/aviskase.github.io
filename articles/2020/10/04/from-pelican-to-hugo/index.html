But live reload became too slow and frustrating (every change took approximately 1-3 minutes).</li><li>I just love to switch gears occasionally. This blog was originally built with <a href=https://jekyllrb.com/ class=external>Jekyll</a> (until mid-2019).</li></ul><p>So, I opened <a href=https://www.staticgen.com/ class=external>StaticGen</a> to check what was trendy. My final choice was between <a href=https://www.gatsbyjs.com/ class=external>Gatsby</a> and <a href=https://gohugo.io/ class=external>Hugo</a>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Gatsby</th><th>Hugo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>JS-based, good for enforcing much-needed JS deep dive</td><td>Go-based, simply cool.</td></tr><tr><td>Very flexible, tons of plugins, data pulling via GraphQL</td><td>Somewhat flexible. Still not sure about plugins.</td></tr><tr><td>Praised for fast loading, especially if you have JS</td><td>Fast building. Extremely fast building.</td></tr><tr><td>Often used for API dev portals</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As you have guessed by the title, I went with Hugo because:</p><ul><li>I don&rsquo;t need JS on the site itself</li><li>I&rsquo;m more interested in fast builds than loading</li><li>I heard that Go is the dumbest language in the world, might as well experience some of it xD</li></ul><h2 id=migration-shenanigans>Migration Shenanigans</h2><p>Pelican and Hugo have a very different template format. Rewriting took most of the time, but as you can see, there are no visual changes. I also had to write Atom feed template almost from scratch and test it to make sure that <code>id</code>&rsquo;s are the same and the whole feed won&rsquo;t be completely regenerated (like it happened the last migration.)</p><p>But Hugo templates are way more flexible than Pelican&rsquo;s. What I had to do with plugins was achieved with core features. I also fell in love with <a href=https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/ class=external>shortcodes</a> and <a href=https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup/#markdown-render-hooks class=external>markdown render hooks</a> which allow further customizations. For example, I used to have a Pelican plugin that detects links to external resources and adds a special <code>external</code> CSS class to them. Now the whole plugin is replaced with one link render hook that I can easily customized as I want later:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-go-html-template data-lang=go-html-template>&lt;<span style=color:#ff79c6>a</span> <span style=color:#50fa7b>href</span><span style=color:#ff79c6>=</span><span style=color:#f1fa8c>&#34;</span><span style=color:#ff79c6>{{</span> <span style=color:#50fa7b>.Destination</span> <span style=color:#ff79c6>|</span> safeURL <span style=color:#ff79c6>}}</span><span style=color:#f1fa8c>&#34;</span><span style=color:#ff79c6>{{</span> <span style=color:#ff79c6>if</span> strings<span style=color:#50fa7b>.HasPrefix</span> <span style=color:#50fa7b>.Destination</span> <span style=color:#f1fa8c>&#34;http&#34;</span> <span style=color:#ff79c6>}}</span> <span style=color:#50fa7b>class</span><span style=color:#ff79c6>=</span><span style=color:#f1fa8c>&#34;external&#34;</span><span style=color:#ff79c6>{{</span> <span style=color:#ff79c6>end</span> <span style=color:#ff79c6>}}</span>&gt;<span style=color:#ff79c6>{{</span> <span style=color:#50fa7b>.Text</span> <span style=color:#ff79c6>|</span> safeHTML <span style=color:#ff79c6>}}</span>&lt;/<span style=color:#ff79c6>a</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Second problem was the markdown sources. They had special Pelican front matter format, not compatible with any supported by Hugo (YAML, TOML, JSON, Org). Yikes. Same for <code>!!! note</code> admonition syntax, <code>kbd</code> auto-detection (all replaced by shortcode), and internal links. I don&rsquo;t have too much content, so most of the work was done via <code>grep</code> and manually replacing stuff.</p><p>Third problem was images. The simple solution would be to set them all to <code>static</code> folder, but it&rsquo;s not a recommended approach because you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use image processing features. Thus, you should go with <code>assets</code> or <a href=https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/ class=external>page bundles</a>. I prefer bundles because they create a clear distinction where each image belongs to.</p><h2 id=changes-to-the-site>Changes to the Site</h2><p>While I was trying to preserve as much as I could, there are some <em>intentional</em> changes:</p><ul><li>No more tagging and categories. I never used them; when I needed to find anything, I just used search. Perhaps it will also force me to make titles more explicit.</li><li>No Google tag (aka analytics). While it had been respecting all possible &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; settings, I ditched it completely. At first, it was fun to watch graphs, incoming sources, and play with smart goals, but after a while I stopped caring. Search console is more than enough.</li><li>No Disqus comments. Not much value in them anyway (maybe I should actually use Twitter? LOL.)</li></ul><h2 id=results>Results</h2><p>I&rsquo;m quite happy with the migration. It is blazing fast as advertised: GitHub action build went from 2-3 minutes down to 30 seconds. Local live reload is faster than it takes to turn my head to the browser tab.</p><p>There is only one problem left. I used <code>img</code> shortcode <a href=https://laurakalbag.com/processing-responsive-images-with-hugo/ class=external>to generate responsive images</a>, but for some reason on my site browsers select too low resolution. I tried to understand why yet couldn&rsquo;t: I had less trouble hacking my way through GnuCash reporting in Scheme (which I don&rsquo;t know) than trying to fix the damn CSS. Current style sheet was borrowed from some theme and reworked over time, but it probably doesn&rsquo;t follow modern best practices. Hugo documentation introduced me to <a href=https://tailwindcss.com/ class=external>Tailwind CSS</a> and <a href=https://postcss.org/ class=external>PostCSS</a>; and while I hate CSS, the time for redesign has come.</p><div class="page-navigation code"><a class=prev href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/09/15/conference-notes-asc-2020/ title="Conference Notes: ASC 2020">&larr; older</a></div></article></main><footer><a href=mailto:aviskase@gmail.com>Yuliya Bagriy</a><span> &#183; 2020 &#183; </span><a href=https://www.aviskase.com/pages/i-dont-track-you/>No tracking</a></footer></body></html>
