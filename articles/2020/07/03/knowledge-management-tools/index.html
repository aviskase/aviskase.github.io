I followed the same process and structure for extra studies like Coursera, and the most important thing I learned was that these notes were never ever opened and referenced later. Useless waste of stationery.</p><p>One of the last examples from English&amp;French practice:</p><p><figure aria-label="Old handwritten notebook"><img alt="Old handwritten notebook" title="Old handwritten notebook" width=1000 height=750 srcset="/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_oldnotes_hu_decc0b50032ec426.webp 1000w, /articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_oldnotes_hu_e2aaebc95cc0a1c.webp 420w, /articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_oldnotes_hu_c3ea1dcecd845a4c.webp 789w," sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw" src=/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_oldnotes_hu_637d148097861099.jpg decoding=async loading=lazy></figure></p><p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love stationery. There was a time when we visited the biggest stationery store almost every day after the classes to gawk on new cute notebooks and pens. If my handwriting wasn&rsquo;t that atrocious, perhaps I&rsquo;d be more into bullet journals and scrapbooks, but alas, it still doesn&rsquo;t make them useful for anything else besides creativity outbursts.</p><p>Now I use paper only for transient scribbles consumed right away or during the day, like this problem solving for <a href=https://adventofcode.com/ class=external-link>advent of code</a>.</p><p><figure aria-label="Untranslatable scribbles"><img alt="Untranslatable scribbles" title="Untranslatable scribbles" width=300 height=400 srcset="/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_notes_hu_f817d0fcbc03c891.webp 300w," sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw" src=/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_notes_hu_fd57f32f8c5bfdbe.jpg decoding=async loading=lazy></figure></p><p>Though, I prefer <a href=https://getrocketbook.com/ class=external-link>Rocketbook</a>, because it&rsquo;s like a mini-whiteboard and I get to enjoy all fancy colors. Here is a note from API design brainstorming:</p><p><figure aria-label="Brainstorming in Rocketbook"><img alt="Brainstorming in Rocketbook" title="Brainstorming in Rocketbook" width=1000 height=750 srcset="/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_rocketbook_hu_2d87f4e4a8b467b.webp 1000w, /articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_rocketbook_hu_a492ec3b34d8833e.webp 420w, /articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_rocketbook_hu_bc4cfd0871f86dce.webp 789w," sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw" src=/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_rocketbook_hu_fbcfa16f3d491d5.jpg decoding=async loading=lazy></figure></p><h2 id=digital><a href=#digital>Digital</a></h2><p>If handwritten notes are useless, digital ones are too chaotic, because I experimented with too many formats.</p><h3 id=non-structured><a href=#non-structured>Non-structured</a></h3><p>The first iterations were a transposition of handwritten notes into digital via <em>Google Docs.</em></p><p><figure aria-label="Notes in the Google Docs"><img alt="Notes in the Google Docs" title="Notes in the Google Docs" width=1304 height=381 srcset="/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_gdocs_hu_582d88d990387e11.webp 1304w, /articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_gdocs_hu_26d44052c7808c8.webp 420w, /articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_gdocs_hu_5894d30ceeab49f8.webp 789w, /articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_gdocs_hu_fb0adcf66f5c42a.webp 1019w," sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw" src=/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_gdocs_hu_270a640482ff29c3.jpg decoding=async loading=lazy></figure></p><p>They are as ineffective as the real notebooks.

Likes to eat memory.</li><li><a href=https://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Home class=external-link>Freeplane</a>: ugly. Very ugly. Unbearably ugly. But free, fast, and has tons of features.</li><li><a href=https://www.mindomo.com/ class=external-link>Mindomo</a>: my latest selection, not free, yet has feature no one else has (more on that later).</li></ul><p>As of now I have an assortment of mind maps in various formats, like <a href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2018/03/19/mega-mind-map-version-2/ class=internal-link>Freeplane</a> or XMind:</p><p><figure aria-label="XMind mind map overview"><img alt="XMind mind map overview" title="XMind mind map overview" width=564 height=394 srcset="/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_xmind_hu_c31ec477dd039c53.webp 564w, /articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_xmind_hu_210c363b5d249c2a.webp 420w," sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw" src=/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_xmind_hu_56471aaa34e8e79d.jpg decoding=async loading=lazy></figure></p><p>I liked mind map for capturing phase, but for some inexplicable reason, I found them uncomfortable for referencing. They have the same fate as old course notes.</p><h3 id=outliners><a href=#outliners>Outliners</a></h3><p>After that realization I discovered <em>outliners:</em> think of them as a marriage between mind maps and bullet lists. You can follow the same tree-like structure and fold/unfold branches, yet with more capabilities for formatting and longer text.</p><p>The most well advertised outliner is <a href=https://workflowy.com/ class=external-link>WorkFlowy</a>, but I never tried it, because I&rsquo;m an awful human being and prefer free stuff xD So the next best alternatives are <a href=https://dynalist.io/ class=external-link>Dynalist</a> and <a href=https://checkvist.com/ class=external-link>Checkvist</a>. Both are fine. There are hundreds of others, some of them are open source and/or crazy and/or vim-like outliners, but as UX junkie, I used those two the most. The reasons to stop were:</p><ul><li>opposite of mind maps: hard to capture, easy to reference</li><li>web-based</li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s why I moved to <a href=https://www.mindomo.com/ class=external-link>Mindomo</a>, because it has a killer feature: switch between mind map and outline view.</p><h3 id=notebooks><a href=#notebooks>Notebooks</a></h3><p>Around the same time as I discovered mind mapping, I saw the need for having long form note storage. Yeah, yeah, Evernote rules the stage. I had it, but the web version became slower and slower, and there was no Linux client, so I played with others. It&rsquo;s hard to remember their names though, I bet I tested more than a dozen.</p><p>For example, <a href=https://simplenote.com/ class=external-link>Simplenote</a>. Nice, but very basic.</p><p>Or extremely Chinese <a href=https://www.wiz.cn/ class=external-link>WizNote</a>.</p><p>The last one ditched just a month ago was <a href=https://joplinapp.org/ class=external-link>Joplin</a>. It&rsquo;s very good, I do recommend it: open source, supports markdown, has a web clipper and an Android app with WebDAV sync. If all you need is more or less suitable Evernote alternative, it&rsquo;s ok. Spoilers: <em>I needed more.</em></p><p>Before we go to the last section, notable mentions:</p><ul><li>LaTeX and RST formats: used them for a while, but Markdown is way easier and better supported.</li><li><a href=https://www.onenote.com/ class=external-link>OneNote</a>: I heard it&rsquo;s fine if you are Windows user. Well, I am not :)</li><li><a href=https://keep.google.com/ class=external-link>Google Keep</a>: perfect inbox for quick notes, shopping, and other lists that I need to access from the phone:</li></ul><p><figure aria-label="Google Keep with transient lists"><img alt="Google Keep with transient lists" title="Google Keep with transient lists" width=920 height=261 srcset="/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_keep_hu_3039148bd9a6de70.webp 920w, /articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_keep_hu_a3d608d76198b54c.webp 420w, /articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_keep_hu_b0a1fc7660b45ed3.webp 789w," sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw" src=/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_keep_hu_db1cb7e65472f5a2.jpg decoding=async loading=lazy></figure></p><h3 id=zettels><a href=#zettels>Zettels</a></h3><p>Ok, that&rsquo;s a wrong term, but it encapsulates what differs from common notebooks the best. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten class=external-link>Zettelkasten</a> is a note-taking method that relies on linking. Overly simplified process is:</p><ul><li>create basic and the smallest possible notes (one concept per note)</li><li>link notes with each other</li><li>group notes thematically</li></ul><p>There are different variations and similar methods, but all of them are based on ability to form concept maps (non-hierarchical storage). Checkout <a href=https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes class=external-link>Andy Matuschak&rsquo;s notes</a> for example.</p><p>The most crucial part is to trace links and backlinks for each note:</p><ul><li>links: note A links to notes B, C, D</li><li>backlinks: note A is linked from notes E, F, J</li></ul><p>Usually it&rsquo;s easy to add links, but cumbersome to add backlinks, because as soon as you link A to B you need to open B and add a link to A. That&rsquo;s a wiki approach.</p><p>There are apps that simplify the process, like <a href=https://obsidian.md/ class=external-link>Obsidian</a>. It has other neat features: link visualization with a graph, note/file transclusion (aka &ldquo;embedding&rdquo;), and tagging.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve started slowly migrating my non-work notes there, and it&rsquo;s hard. You get used to rigid hierarchies based on folders. You don&rsquo;t have to stop using them, but it makes sense with approaches like <a href=https://github.com/nickmilo/IMF-v3 class=external-link>@nickmilo&rsquo;s</a> (which I follow loosely).</p><h2 id=non-text-content><a href=#non-text-content>Non-text content</a></h2><p>Only digital:</p><ul><li><a href=https://inkscape.org/ class=external-link>Inkscape</a>: my go-to drawing app since I&rsquo;m better with vector graphics.</li><li><a href=https://krita.org class=external-link>Krita</a>: when I learn how to draw with my graphic tablet xD</li><li><a href=https://excalidraw.com/ class=external-link>Excalidraw</a>: discovered via Obsidian&rsquo;s Discord. Will use it for graphs.</li><li>LibreOffice Impress: not a drawing app, but for those situations when I need a presentation.</li><li><a href=https://shutter-project.org/ class=external-link>Shutter</a>: screenshots with annotations, more than enough for everyday usage. Or <a href=https://getsharex.com/ class=external-link>ShareX</a> when on Windows.</li><li><a href=https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/ class=external-link>SimpleScreenRecorder</a> for short screencasts. People who use GIF for that: <em>burn in hell.</em></li></ul><h2 id=summary><a href=#summary>Summary</a></h2><p>Let&rsquo;s summarize. Handwritten notes:</p><ul><li>use whiteboarding format (can easily &ldquo;edit&rdquo; by cleaning)</li><li>transient, not for long-term storage</li><li>for generating ideas or designs</li><li>for small tasks during the day</li></ul><p>One important exception is recipes. All are handwritten on small cards and stored in the box. The reason is to pull one out and stick to the fridge with a magnet. I don&rsquo;t have much recipes anyway, so searching and storage aren&rsquo;t a problem.</p><p>For digital:</p><ul><li>Mindomo when I <em>really</em> want a mind map. Something tells me I won&rsquo;t.</li><li>Sublime PlainNotes for transient notes and copy pastes.</li><li>Google Keep for semi-transient lists and inbox.</li><li>Obsidian for anything else, except overly work related (I prefer to experiment with it more on the free tier before paying for commercial license).</li></ul><p>And for non-text content, imagine the entire section <em>transcluded</em> here ;)</p><p>The last important bit: almost all my data is backed up in some way. Google Disk, Yandex.Drive, and OneDrive. I once lost a hard drive with my end-of-semester projects and 300GB of carefully collected music (which I never recovered). Make backups. And backup some backups.</p></article><nav class=article-nav aria-label="Post navigation"><span class=article-nav-old><a href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/01/hmms-june/ title="Hmms: June" aria-label="Go to older post"><span class=arrow>◁</span>older</a>
