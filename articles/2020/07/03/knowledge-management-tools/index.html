Currently, I play with the new shiny app, so I figured it&rsquo;s a perfect moment to systemize and reflect on tools and techniques I used until now.</p><h2 id=handwritten>Handwritten</h2><p>I was more into handwriting during school and university, and there are still tons of notebooks back in Kazakhstan with course notes. I followed the same process and structure for extra studies like Coursera, and the most important thing I learned was that these notes were never ever opened and referenced later. Useless waste of stationery.</p><p>One of the last examples from English&French practice:</p><p><img width=1000 height=750 sizes="(min-width: 1180px) 888px, (min-width: 960px) calc(49.5vw + 314px), (min-width: 600px) calc(100vw - 40px), 100vw" srcset="https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_oldnotes_hu966eabb7042cba590489bc15c71caa08_405591_500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 500w, https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_oldnotes_hu966eabb7042cba590489bc15c71caa08_405591_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 800w" src=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_oldnotes.jpg alt="Old handwritten notebook"></p><p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love stationery. There was a time when we visited the biggest stationery store almost every day after the classes to gawk on new cute notebooks and pens. If my handwriting wasn&rsquo;t that atrocious, perhaps I&rsquo;d be more into bullet journals and scrapbooks, but alas, it still doesn&rsquo;t make them useful for anything else besides creativity outbursts.</p><p>Now I use paper only for transient scribbles consumed right away or during the day, like this problem solving for <a href=https://adventofcode.com/ class=external>advent of code</a>.</p><p><img width=300 height=400 sizes="(min-width: 1180px) 888px, (min-width: 960px) calc(49.5vw + 314px), (min-width: 600px) calc(100vw - 40px), 100vw" srcset src=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_notes.jpg alt="Untranslatable scribbles"></p><p>Though, I prefer <a href=https://getrocketbook.com/ class=external>Rocketbook</a>, because it&rsquo;s like a mini-whiteboard and I get to enjoy all fancy colors. Here is a note from API design brainstorming:</p><p><img width=1000 height=750 sizes="(min-width: 1180px) 888px, (min-width: 960px) calc(49.5vw + 314px), (min-width: 600px) calc(100vw - 40px), 100vw" srcset="https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_rocketbook_hueb28916bbd75b1bfd9acc9a71b4e419c_202967_500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 500w, https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_rocketbook_hueb28916bbd75b1bfd9acc9a71b4e419c_202967_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 800w" src=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_rocketbook.jpg alt="Brainstorming in Rocketbook"></p><h2 id=digital>Digital</h2><p>If handwritten notes are useless, digital ones are too chaotic, because I experimented with too many formats.</p><h3 id=non-structured>Non-structured</h3><p>The first iterations were a transposition of handwritten notes into digital via <em>Google Docs.</em></p><p><img width=1304 height=381 sizes="(min-width: 1180px) 888px, (min-width: 960px) calc(49.5vw + 314px), (min-width: 600px) calc(100vw - 40px), 100vw" srcset="https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_gdocs_hufa58e120375260f0cde684b8fe8fce22_58824_500x0_resize_box_2.png 500w, https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_gdocs_hufa58e120375260f0cde684b8fe8fce22_58824_800x0_resize_box_2.png 800w, https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_gdocs_hufa58e120375260f0cde684b8fe8fce22_58824_1200x0_resize_box_2.png 1200w" src=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_gdocs.png alt="Notes in the Google Docs"></p><p>They are as ineffective as the real notebooks. Type once and forget.</p><p>The direct opposite are <em>plain text notes</em> in <a href=https://www.sublimetext.com/ class=external>Sublime</a> with <a href=https://github.com/aziz/PlainNotes class=external>PlainNotes</a> plugin. I use them almost every day for:</p><ul><li>transient notes like &ldquo;did this during the smoke test&rdquo;</li><li>common copy pastes</li></ul><p><img width=834 height=494 sizes="(min-width: 1180px) 888px, (min-width: 960px) calc(49.5vw + 314px), (min-width: 600px) calc(100vw - 40px), 100vw" srcset="https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_sublime_hu11c88f6b4f8e4d4566211d83825cf277_32652_500x0_resize_box_2.png 500w, https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_sublime_hu11c88f6b4f8e4d4566211d83825cf277_32652_800x0_resize_box_2.png 800w" src=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_sublime.png alt="Sublime with PlainNotes"></p><h3 id=mind-maps>Mind Maps</h3><p>At some point I learned about <em>mind mapping</em> and tried almost all installable applications for that, including:</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.xmind.net/ class=external>XMind</a>: UX is great, but features in the free tier are meh, especially in the last versions. Likes to eat memory.</li><li><a href=https://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Home class=external>Freeplane</a>: ugly. Very ugly. Unbearably ugly. But free, fast, and has tons of features.</li><li><a href=https://www.mindomo.com/ class=external>Mindomo</a>: my latest selection, not free, yet has feature no one else has (more on that later).</li></ul><p>As of now I have an assortment of mind maps in various formats, like <a href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2018/03/19/mega-mind-map-version-2/>Freeplane</a> or XMind:</p><p><img width=564 height=394 sizes="(min-width: 1180px) 888px, (min-width: 960px) calc(49.5vw + 314px), (min-width: 600px) calc(100vw - 40px), 100vw" srcset="https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_xmind_hu9c32adda7f2c091cd2c5509224b7043c_84994_500x0_resize_box_2.png 500w" src=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_xmind.png alt="XMind mind map overview"></p><p>I liked mind map for capturing phase, but for some inexplicable reason, I found them uncomfortable for referencing. They have the same fate as old course notes.</p><h3 id=outliners>Outliners</h3><p>After that realization I discovered <em>outliners:</em> think of them as a marriage between mind maps and bullet lists. You can follow the same tree-like structure and fold/unfold branches, yet with more capabilities for formatting and longer text.</p><p>The most well advertised outliner is <a href=https://workflowy.com/ class=external>WorkFlowy</a>, but I never tried it, because I&rsquo;m an awful human being and prefer free stuff xD So the next best alternatives are <a href=https://dynalist.io/ class=external>Dynalist</a> and <a href=https://checkvist.com/ class=external>Checkvist</a>. Both are fine. There are hundreds of others, some of them are open source and/or crazy and/or vim-like outliners, but as UX junkie, I used those two the most. The reasons to stop were:</p><ul><li>opposite of mind maps: hard to capture, easy to reference</li><li>web-based</li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s why I moved to <a href=https://www.mindomo.com/ class=external>Mindomo</a>, because it has a killer feature: switch between mind map and outline view.</p><h3 id=notebooks>Notebooks</h3><p>Around the same time as I discovered mind mapping, I saw the need for having long form note storage. Yeah, yeah, Evernote rules the stage. I had it, but the web version became slower and slower, and there was no Linux client, so I played with others. It&rsquo;s hard to remember their names though, I bet I tested more than a dozen.</p><p>For example, <a href=https://simplenote.com/ class=external>Simplenote</a>. Nice, but very basic.</p><p>Or extremely Chinese <a href=https://www.wiz.cn/ class=external>WizNote</a>.</p><p>The last one ditched just a month ago was <a href=https://joplinapp.org/ class=external>Joplin</a>. It&rsquo;s very good, I do recommend it: open source, supports markdown, has a web clipper and an Android app with WebDAV sync. If all you need is more or less suitable Evernote alternative, it&rsquo;s ok. Spoilers: <em>I needed more.</em></p><p>Before we go to the last section, notable mentions:</p><ul><li>LaTeX and RST formats: used them for a while, but Markdown is way easier and better supported.</li><li><a href=https://www.onenote.com/ class=external>OneNote</a>: I heard it&rsquo;s fine if you are Windows user. Well, I am not :)</li><li><a href=https://keep.google.com/ class=external>Google Keep</a>: perfect inbox for quick notes, shopping, and other lists that I need to access from the phone:</li></ul><p><img width=920 height=261 sizes="(min-width: 1180px) 888px, (min-width: 960px) calc(49.5vw + 314px), (min-width: 600px) calc(100vw - 40px), 100vw" srcset="https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_keep_hub3cedfb4d79ea0809104fd94b53e170b_40871_500x0_resize_box_2.png 500w, https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_keep_hub3cedfb4d79ea0809104fd94b53e170b_40871_800x0_resize_box_2.png 800w" src=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/03/knowledge-management-tools/km_keep.png alt="Google Keep with transient lists"></p><h3 id=zettels>Zettels</h3><p>Ok, that&rsquo;s a wrong term, but it encapsulates what differs from common notebooks the best. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten class=external>Zettelkasten</a> is a note-taking method that relies on linking. Overly simplified process is:</p><ul><li>create basic and the smallest possible notes (one concept per note)</li><li>link notes with each other</li><li>group notes thematically</li></ul><p>There are different variations and similar methods, but all of them are based on ability to form concept maps (non-hierarchical storage). Checkout <a href=https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes class=external>Andy Matuschak&rsquo;s notes</a> for example.</p><p>The most crucial part is to trace links and backlinks for each note:</p><ul><li>links: note A links to notes B, C, D</li><li>backlinks: note A is linked from notes E, F, J</li></ul><p>Usually it&rsquo;s easy to add links, but cumbersome to add backlinks, because as soon as you link A to B you need to open B and add a link to A. That&rsquo;s a wiki approach.</p><p>There are apps that simplify the process, like <a href=https://obsidian.md/ class=external>Obsidian</a>. It has other neat features: link visualization with a graph, note/file transclusion (aka &ldquo;embedding&rdquo;), and tagging.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve started slowly migrating my non-work notes there, and it&rsquo;s hard. You get used to rigid hierarchies based on folders. You don&rsquo;t have to stop using them, but it makes sense with approaches like <a href=https://github.com/nickmilo/IMF-v3 class=external>@nickmilo&rsquo;s</a> (which I follow loosely).</p><h2 id=non-text-content>Non-Text Content</h2><p>Only digital:</p><ul><li><a href=https://inkscape.org/ class=external>Inkscape</a>: my go-to drawing app since I&rsquo;m better with vector graphics.</li><li><a href=https://krita.org class=external>Krita</a>: when I learn how to draw with my graphic tablet xD</li><li><a href=https://excalidraw.com/ class=external>Excalidraw</a>: discovered via Obsidian&rsquo;s Discord. Will use it for graphs.</li><li>LibreOffice Impress: not a drawing app, but for those situations when I need a presentation.</li><li><a href=https://shutter-project.org/ class=external>Shutter</a>: screenshots with annotations, more than enough for everyday usage. Or <a href=https://getsharex.com/ class=external>ShareX</a> when on Windows.</li><li><a href=https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/ class=external>SimpleScreenRecorder</a> for short screencasts. People who use GIF for that: <em>burn in hell.</em></li></ul><h2 id=summary>Summary</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s summarize. Handwritten notes:</p><ul><li>use whiteboarding format (can easily &ldquo;edit&rdquo; by cleaning)</li><li>transient, not for long-term storage</li><li>for generating ideas or designs</li><li>for small tasks during the day</li></ul><p>One important exception is recipes. All are handwritten on small cards and stored in the box. The reason is to pull one out and stick to the fridge with a magnet. I don&rsquo;t have much recipes anyway, so searching and storage aren&rsquo;t a problem.</p><p>For digital:</p><ul><li>Mindomo when I <em>really</em> want a mind map. Something tells me I won&rsquo;t.</li><li>Sublime PlainNotes for transient notes and copy pastes.</li><li>Google Keep for semi-transient lists and inbox.</li><li>Obsidian for anything else, except overly work related (I prefer to experiment with it more on the free tier before paying for commercial license).</li></ul><p>And for non-text content, imagine the entire section <em>transcluded</em> here ;)</p><p>The last important bit: almost all my data is backed up in some way. Google Disk, Yandex.Drive, and OneDrive. I once lost a hard drive with my end-of-semester projects and 300GB of carefully collected music (which I never recovered). Make backups. And backup some backups.</p><div class="page-navigation code"><a class=prev href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/07/01/hmms-june/ title="Hmms: June">&larr; older</a>
