  Learning

One of the good things to emerge during the corona times is more educational opportunities.
For example, you can (and perhaps should) check the
&ldquo;Advanced Distributed Systems Design&rdquo; course by Udi Dahan.
Another way to satisfy knowledge thirst is to attend a virtual conference:

API The Docs hosts bite-sized virtual events with discussion opportunities.
AsyncAPI has finished already, but you can watch it on YouTube.
OnlineTestConf is soon. I&rsquo;m particularly excited about
&ldquo;The Lessons we can Learn from the Aviation Industry&rdquo; by Conor Fitzgerald.

Any &ldquo;IT person&rdquo; should have a favorite monospaced font. Except for those weirdos who prefer non-monospaced.
I wasn&rsquo;t very original in this matter and used Fira Code because it has
ligatures and proper support for Cyrillic."><meta property="twitter:description" content="

I wasn&rsquo;t very original in this matter and used <a href=https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode class=external-link>Fira Code</a> because it has
ligatures and proper support for Cyrillic.</p><p>Any &ldquo;IT person&rdquo; should also have a favorite IDE. Mine is PyCharm by JetBrains. Recently an amazing thing has happened:
JetBrains released their own monospaced font, <a href=https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/ class=external-link>JetBrains Mono</a>. The key feature is
an increased height of lowercase letters. Love it!</p><h2 id=fam0us><a href=#fam0us>Fam0us</a></h2><p>I participated in <a href=https://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/abt-343-yuliya-bagriy-aviskase/ class=external-link>the podcast hosted by Alan Page</a>.</p><p>In retrospect, I should have &ldquo;rehearsed&rdquo; a bit more. For example, I somehow was able to forget the phrase
<em>open-book management.</em> Or some answers could be more laconic and concise. Nevertheless, it was a great experience.</p><h2 id=visible-work><a href=#visible-work>Visible work</a></h2><p>I slowly write <a href=https://netgovern.github.io/api-guidelines class=external-link>our API guidelines</a>. Still work in progress,
but it&rsquo;s cool to have bits of your work visible and perhaps at some point serving others.
My admiration for companies who published their guidelines in the same matter
grew immensely: Adidas, PayPal, Heroku, Microsoft, Zalando, etc. It really helps to be able to see real artifacts and
not just generic NDA-sanitized dev blog posts.</p></article><div class=article-nav><span class=article-nav-old><a href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/04/22/using-insomnia-for-api-exploration/ title="Using Insomnia for API exploration"><span class=arrow>◁</span>older</a>
