&ldquo;The Lessons we can Learn from the Aviation Industry&rdquo; by Conor Fitzgerald.</li></ul><h1 id=new-font>New font</h1><p>Any &ldquo;IT person&rdquo; should have a favorite monospaced font. Except for those weirdos who prefer non-monospaced.
I wasn&rsquo;t very original in this matter and used <a href=https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode class=external>Fira Code</a> because it has
ligatures and proper support for Cyrillic.</p><p>Any &ldquo;IT person&rdquo; should also have a favorite IDE. Mine is PyCharm by JetBrains. Recently an amazing thing has happened:
JetBrains released their own monospaced font, <a href=https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/ class=external>JetBrains Mono</a>. The key feature is
an increased height of lowercase letters. Love it!</p><h1 id=fam0us>Fam0us</h1><p>I participated in <a href=https://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/abt-343-yuliya-bagriy-aviskase/ class=external>the podcast hosted by Alan Page</a>.</p><p>In retrospect, I should have &ldquo;rehearsed&rdquo; a bit more. For example, I somehow was able to forget the phrase
<em>open-book management.</em> Or some answers could be more laconic and concise. Nevertheless, it was a great experience.</p><h1 id=visible-work>Visible work</h1><p>I slowly write <a href=https://netgovern.github.io/api-guidelines class=external>our API guidelines</a>. Still work in progress,
but it&rsquo;s cool to have bits of your work visible and perhaps at some point serving others.
My admiration for companies who published their guidelines in the same matter
grew immensely: Adidas, PayPal, Heroku, Microsoft, Zalando, etc. It really helps to be able to see real artifacts and
not just generic NDA-sanitized dev blog posts.</p><div class="page-navigation code"><a class=prev href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/04/22/using-insomnia-for-api-exploration/ title="Using Insomnia for API exploration">&larr; older</a>
