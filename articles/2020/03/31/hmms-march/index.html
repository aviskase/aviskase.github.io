Top X Videos and Readings   Erik Wilde started a video series about API design, and the last one covers pros and cons of exposing system APIs.
  Tyk explains why you shouldn&rsquo;t write our own API gateway. I particularly liked this part:

I particularly liked this part:</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Another chose to build their own API gateway because no offerings existed that would operate in their
preferred Windows-based server environment.
I haven’t heard from them since as they still haven’t shipped their product &mdash; a full year later.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>Adidas has awesome API guidelines and recently they&rsquo;ve published <a href=https://github.com/adidas/api-pm-training class=external>their API training for PMs</a>.
If they ever decide to offer public trainings, I would love to participate: some of the modules are a bit too
business-y for me to comprehend without hands-on experience.</p></li><li><p>Almost non-API topic. Why you should always carefully read RFCs and standards: in this case,
<a href=https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2020/02/24/why-the-gov-uk-design-system-team-changed-the-input-type-for-numbers/ class=external>what is the proper input type for numbers</a>.</p></li></ul><h2 id=testing-vs-dx>Testing vs DX</h2><p>While I was reading <a href=https://nordicapis.com/why-your-api-needs-a-dedicated-developer-experience-team/ class=external>an article about DX teams</a>,
it came to me that I&rsquo;m (at least partially) not a tester. I mean, I knew it, but I didn&rsquo;t have a proper name for that.</p><p>So, what does DX specialist do?</p><ul><li>API design</li><li>QA. Clarification: not the obvious &ldquo;I&rsquo;m capable of sending requests&rdquo; part, but more about contract testing, linting,
style guides, and docs.</li><li>Tooling</li><li>Developer relations</li></ul><p>What&rsquo;s funny is that if you read that article carefully you won&rsquo;t find any mentions of testers.
None. There are tech writers, advocates, but no testers whatsoever. In fact, in any non-Postman induced article about API
there are no presence of testers. <em>And it&rsquo;s totally fine.</em></p><h2 id=remote-work>Remote Work</h2><p>Sorry, it&rsquo;s not totally coronavirus-free edition. Almost everyone works remotely now, so there is an avalanche of
articles about how to work from home. The company I dearly love even decided to offer <em>a payed</em> conference (frack you).</p><p>I&rsquo;ve started my career as a fully remote worker and was there for three years. Next two years I was working from home
at least one day a week, often more. One would say I have immense amount of tips and tricks to share, but <em>I don&rsquo;t</em>.
Because I&rsquo;ve never been accustomed to the office work in the first place. I had to learn how to work NOT from home.</p><p>All the sad things aside, it&rsquo;s curious how much this experience can change companies in the positive way.
Some didn&rsquo;t even consider before that their work can be done remotely. Perhaps we will see a surge of remote-friendly
and/or flexible hours positions (which are rare at the moment)?</p><div class="page-navigation code"><a class=prev href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/03/08/hmms-february/ title="Hmms: February">&larr; older</a>
