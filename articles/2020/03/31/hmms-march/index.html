Erik Wilde started a video series about API design,
and the last one covers pros and cons of exposing system APIs.
Tyk explains why you shouldn&rsquo;t write our own API gateway. I particularly liked this part:



    Another chose to build their own API gateway because no offerings existed that would operate in their
preferred Windows-based server environment.
I haven’t heard from them since as they still haven’t shipped their product &mdash; a full year later."><meta property="twitter:description" content="Coronavirus-free edition!

If they ever decide to offer public trainings, I would love to participate: some of the modules are a bit too
business-y for me to comprehend without hands-on experience.</li><li>Almost non-API topic. Why you should always carefully read RFCs and standards: in this case,

it came to me that I&rsquo;m (at least partially) not a tester. I mean, I knew it, but I didn&rsquo;t have a proper name for that.</p><p>So, what does DX specialist do?</p><ul><li>API design</li><li>QA. Clarification: not the obvious &ldquo;I&rsquo;m capable of sending requests&rdquo; part, but more about contract testing, linting, style guides, and docs.</li><li>Tooling</li><li>Developer relations</li></ul><p>What&rsquo;s funny is that if you read that article carefully you won&rsquo;t find any mentions of testers.
None. There are tech writers, advocates, but no testers whatsoever. In fact, in any non-Postman induced article about API
there are no presence of testers. <em>And it&rsquo;s totally fine.</em></p><h2 id=remote-work><a href=#remote-work>Remote work</a></h2><p>Sorry, it&rsquo;s not totally coronavirus-free edition. Almost everyone works remotely now, so there is an avalanche of
articles about how to work from home. The company I dearly love even decided to offer <em>a payed</em> conference (frack you).</p><p>I&rsquo;ve started my career as a fully remote worker and was there for three years. Next two years I was working from home
at least one day a week, often more. One would say I have immense amount of tips and tricks to share, but <em>I don&rsquo;t</em>.
Because I&rsquo;ve never been accustomed to the office work in the first place. I had to learn how to work NOT from home.</p><p>All the sad things aside, it&rsquo;s curious how much this experience can change companies in the positive way.
Some didn&rsquo;t even consider before that their work can be done remotely. Perhaps we will see a surge of remote-friendly
and/or flexible hours positions (which are rare at the moment)?</p></article><div class=article-nav><span class=article-nav-old><a href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/03/08/hmms-february/ title="Hmms: February"><span class=arrow>◁</span>older</a>
