I&rsquo;d be committed, but you&rsquo;d only be involved.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>I bet I won&rsquo;t say anything new or profound, but it always weirds me out that the pig is considered somewhat more important than the chicken. Oh, right, because <em>it must die</em> to be useful.</p><p>Well, I grew up in the 90s in Kazakhstan. Like many people we were relying on our village relatives for food, so ham and egg production is not an elegant metaphor but a real-life experience for me.</p><p>Growing pigs is a <em>slow process</em> with a big <em>one-time payoff</em>. It&rsquo;s not free: you need to feed them and clean the place. And you&rsquo;d better have a pair of pigs so that the production could be at least somewhat renewable. One committed pig is a splendid feast in the short term and hunger in the long term. Don&rsquo;t forget an emotional cost: pigs don&rsquo;t die by themselves. You will hear it. You will <em>smell</em> it.</p><p>Chicken produces eggs <em>continuously</em>. You don&rsquo;t even need a rooster. Feeding is less involved, and you may practice a free-range approach to optimize costs. With a rooster, eggs can be fertilized, and production might grow even more.</p><p>Thus, in my opinion, <strong>chicken-style contributors are better for a project</strong>. They bring <em>sustainability</em>. They create small <del>eggs</del> incremental improvements. They are the force of kaizen.</p><p>Whereas pigs are one-time Big Bang doers. An external contractor who came in, said you need to redo the entire workflow, got their paycheck, and left. That new employee who said: &ldquo;let&rsquo;s rewrite the system from scratch!&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, sometimes big changes are healthy and bring value, but they are also riskier. You need to have a bunch of chickens to support the process.</p><p>Another possible consequence for pigs is burnout. You did something big and you can&rsquo;t do anything else anymore. Oops.</p><p>I often gravitate towards pig&rsquo;s tendencies since it&rsquo;s easier. It&rsquo;s also better for CV and performance evaluations, isn&rsquo;t it? ;) But in the end, as some say: we prefer being generalists; the same way I&rsquo;d say: let&rsquo;s be chickens who oink occasionally.</p></article><div class=article-nav><span class=article-nav-old><a href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/08/04/hmms-july/ title="Hmms: July"><span class=arrow>◁</span>older</a>
