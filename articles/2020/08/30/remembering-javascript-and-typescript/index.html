I&rsquo;m not an expert, but have a fair understanding of PEPs and practices.</p><p>But now I work with JavaScript/TypeScript project, and my knowledge is definitely lacking. I was following these only in the university, when there was still a chance that I had to do web development. I distinctly remember the moment of downloading <a href=https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/this%20&%20object%20prototypes/README.md#you-dont-know-js-this--object-prototypes class=external>&ldquo;You Don&rsquo;t Know JS: this & Object Prototypes&rdquo;</a> book and thinking &ldquo;nope, that&rsquo;s it, I don&rsquo;t want to deal with such language.&rdquo;</p><p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m in dire need of relearning JS and TS. After experience with Python I know better how important it is to lint, follow a style guide, and type, type, type it all. For learning I prefer books and articles, but also noticed growing appreciation for videos. Yes, they are less efficient, longer, but you can use them during some &ldquo;brainless&rdquo; time and revisit interesting topics afterwards in a more thorough fashion.</p><p>Here is the list of resources I&rsquo;m using now:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;You Don&rsquo;t Know JS Yet (book series)&rdquo; by Kyle Simpson, <a href=https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS class=external>2nd</a> and <a href=https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/README.md class=external>1st</a> editions. Keep in mind, the author is known for some controversial views, don&rsquo;t treat these books as a holy grail. Do your research (as always).</li><li><a href=https://javascript.info/ class=external>javascript.info</a></li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia/ class=external>Traversy Media channel on YouTube</a></li><li><a href=https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/ class=external>ECMAScript compatibility</a> and <a href=https://node.green/ class=external>node.js support</a> tables. Nice for quick links to standards and docs.</li><li>Good old <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org class=external>MDN</a>.</li><li><a href=https://github.com/airbnb/javascript class=external>Airbnb JavaScript style guide</a> and <a href=https://standardjs.com/ class=external>Standard style</a> for checking practices. You can learn interesting things just by reading rules and discussions that introduced them.</li><li>Official <a href=https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html class=external>&ldquo;The TypeScript Handbook&rdquo;</a>.</li><li><a href=https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/ class=external>&ldquo;TypeScript Deep Dive&rdquo;</a> by Basarat Ali and his <a href=https://www.youtube.com/basaratali class=external>YouTube channel</a>.</li><li>Courses from <a href=https://frontendmasters.com/ class=external>FrontendMasters</a>. Still <em>evaluating</em>, but I don&rsquo;t believe the price is worth it for me. But if you&rsquo;re a video-oriented learner, I suppose, this resource is one of the best, simply because these courses are updated.</li></ul><p>On the side note, I think I&rsquo;ll be migrating this blog from Pelican to Hugo (learning Go, why not) or something JS-y for a nice added practice. Though, the actual reason is that it&rsquo;s built with an older Pelican version, which is very slow, so I have to spend time on either upgrading or migrating anyway.</p><div class="page-navigation code"><a class=prev href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2020/08/20/postmortem-borking-ubuntu-again/ title="Postmortem: Borking Ubuntu (Again)">&larr; older</a>
