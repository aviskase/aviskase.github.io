It was discussed in the <a href=https://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/ab-testing-episode-94-modern-testing-meets-context-driven-testing/>AB Testing episode 94</a> and at least for Alan and Brent there is no real contradiction.</div><p>It looks like there are two main themes in that article.</p><h2 id=theme-one-finding-a-job-as-a-tester><a href=#theme-one-finding-a-job-as-a-tester class="header-link hidden">#</a>Theme One: Finding a Job as a Tester</h2><p>A bit of a background: when I was writing that piece, I was in depression. That&rsquo;s a different story about development culture and its effect on one&rsquo;s mind, but I&rsquo;ll write about it sometime later. So, depression. And a bit of worrying about getting the first job locally in Canada.</p><p>No wonder that rereading the article now feel like the main takeaway was &ldquo;software development is a shitty business, whatever progress will be made, there will be still more than enough companies to hire testers.&rdquo; And I won&rsquo;t argue <em>the last part.</em> Modern testing principles are things to strive for, but my experience so far tells me that it&rsquo;s too optimistic to assume that <em>all</em> companies will end up there. So, there will be enough companies who will lag behind. Ergo, there will be enough positions for <em>any</em> testers. Even for mindless test case executors.</p><p>Now, the question is, do I <em>want</em> to work in such companies? <strong>No.</strong></p><p>If I would want to continue as a tester-generalist, without specializing in some future-proof niches like pentest or perftest (at least, they seem to be future-proof), a sweet spot would be companies closer on a way to the &ldquo;tester-less&rdquo; transformation, but still needing some help on that way. Will there be enough such companies? Probably, yes. Getting position will be definitely harder but not impossible.</p><h2 id=theme-two-clay-metaphor><a href=#theme-two-clay-metaphor class="header-link hidden">#</a>Theme Two: Clay Metaphor</h2><p>Nowadays I agree even more with the metaphor I came up with in that article. Yes, we are a clay or a sealing foam. We, testers, should help others in improving quality. That means that our work is immensely context-dependent: different organizations need different &ldquo;holes&rdquo; to seal.</p><p>But we can go on even further with this metaphor: make it&rsquo;s not just a clay, but a sci-fi fancy-shmancy clay which heals holes and scabs when applied. Yup, that means that after some time we won&rsquo;t be needed in this organization; that&rsquo;s fine. You can move to some other position where your experience being adaptable and generalizing could be of assistance. Or you can find other organization and kill testing position there too.</p><hr><p>As a result, while some wording was off, core principles still sound ok to me: adapt, help&heal, move on.</p></article></main><footer class="justify-center flex w-full py-4 text-16"><a class="border-b-2 border-transparent hover:border-primary" href=mailto:aviskase@gmail.com>Yuliya Bagriy</a><span> &#183; 2020 &#183; </span><a class="border-b-2 border-transparent hover:border-primary" href=https://www.aviskase.com/pages/i-dont-track-you/>No tracking</a></footer></div></body></html>
