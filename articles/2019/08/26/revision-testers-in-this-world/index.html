    <p>Recently I&rsquo;ve remembered <a href="https://aviskase.github.io/articles/2018/01/23/testers-in-this-world/">my old article</a> and wondered, how much my thoughts  have changed and how they align to the principles of context-driven and modern testing (and yes, I don&rsquo;t see them as contradicting each&nbsp;other).</p>
<p>It looks like there are two main themes in that&nbsp;article.</p>
<h2>Theme One: Finding a Job as a&nbsp;Tester</h2>
<p>A bit of a background: when I was writing that piece, I was in depression. That&rsquo;s a different story about development culture and its effect on one&rsquo;s mind, but I&rsquo;ll write about it sometime later. So, depression. And a bit of worrying about getting the first job locally in&nbsp;Canada.</p>
<p>No wonder that rereading the article now feel like the main takeaway was &ldquo;software development is a shitty business, whatever progress will be made, there will be still more than enough companies to hire testers.&rdquo; And I won&rsquo;t argue <em>the last part.</em> Modern testing principles are things to strive for, but my experience so far tells me that it&rsquo;s too optimistic to assume that <em>all</em> companies will end up there. So, there will be enough companies who will lag behind. Ergo, there will be enough positions for <em>any</em> testers. Even for mindless test case&nbsp;executors. </p>
<p>Now, the question is, do I <em>want</em> to work in such companies? <strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>If I would want to continue as a tester-generalist, without specializing in some future-proof niches like pentest or perftest (at least, they seem to be future-proof), a sweet spot would be companies closer on a way to the &ldquo;tester-less&rdquo; transformation, but still needing some help on that way. Will there be enough such companies? Probably, yes. Getting position will be definitely harder but not&nbsp;impossible.</p>
<h2>Theme Two: Clay&nbsp;Metaphor</h2>
<p>Nowadays I agree even more with the metaphor I came up with in that article. Yes, we are a clay or a sealing foam. We, testers, should help others in improving quality. That means that our work is immensely context-dependent: different organizations need different &ldquo;holes&rdquo; to&nbsp;seal. </p>
<p>But we can go on even further with this metaphor: make it&rsquo;s not just a clay, but a sci-fi fancy-shmancy clay which heals holes and scabs when applied. Yup, that means that after some time we won&rsquo;t be needed in this organization; that&rsquo;s fine. You can move to some other position where your experience being adaptable and generalizing could be of assistance. Or you can find other organization and kill testing position there&nbsp;too. </p>
<hr>
<p>As a result, while some wording was off, core principles still sound ok to me: adapt, help&amp;heal, move&nbsp;on.</p>
