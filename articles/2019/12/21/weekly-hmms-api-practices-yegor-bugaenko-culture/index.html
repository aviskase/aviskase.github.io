    <h2><span class="caps">API</span> Practices If You Hate Your&nbsp;Customers</h2>
<p>A fun <a class="external" href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=rss&amp;id=3375635">article from <span class="caps">ACM</span> Queue magazine</a> about how to alienate
customers from using your <span class="caps">API</span>. I like an <a class="external" href="https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2019/09/02/your-api-is-your-public-image/">&ldquo;anti-tutorial&rdquo; form</a>, 
it is easier to recall bad patterns and&nbsp;behaviors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One such form I filled out required me to describe the application I planned to write. &lt;&hellip;&gt;
Sadly, I didn&rsquo;t have a particular application in mind. I was going to explore the <span class="caps">API</span> and write a few simple 
Python-based utilities to automate some daily tasks. I didn&rsquo;t want to explain all that, however, for fear that 
my answer would not be good enough for whoever was judging my application. 
In a panic, I simply described my application as &ldquo;dark purple with white highlights.&rdquo; 
A few weeks later my application was approved. So far, I haven&rsquo;t been visited by any auditor <span class="caps">SWAT</span> teams, 
but as a precaution my code editor has been themed in dark purple with white highlights ever&nbsp;since.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This particular quote hit&nbsp;hard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing says &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t actually want you to use our <span class="caps">API</span>&rdquo; like making your <span class="caps">API</span> documentation invisible 
to search engines. The &ldquo;build, run, debug&rdquo; cycle of decades ago has been replaced by &ldquo;run, crash, Google,&nbsp;fix.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once we tried to research our competitors and we couldn&rsquo;t find even screenshots. How the hell 
a potential customer is supposed to evaluate your product if you hide <strong>everything</strong>?</p>
<h2>Yegor Bugaenko on <span class="caps">QA</span> vs&nbsp;Testing</h2>
<p>Yegor Bugaenko presented <a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZitXMQaXvE">&ldquo;Quality Assurance vs. Testing&rdquo; on <span class="caps">QA</span> Fest 2019</a>.</p>
<p>And I am&nbsp;disappointed. </p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know Yegor, he is famous for controversial <a class="external" href="https://www.xdsd.org/">eXtremely Distributed Software Development</a> 
methodology. One of the ideas is to pay only for closed&nbsp;tasks.</p>
<p>So, I grabbed popcorn and expected blood and gore. Didn&rsquo;t happen, it was dull, except for one or two topics.
The talk started with an obvious difference between <span class="caps">QA</span> and testing and moved to explain the importance of 
quantitative metrics to measure tester&rsquo;s productivity. Unfortunately, he suggested the most stupid metric ever: the 
number of bugs logged. I also was annoyed by his notion that testers should not talk to devs much and must log every issue. 
My practice shows that working with dev together and fixing bugs as we go is way more productive and requires less time. 
Perhaps, his ideas works in <span class="caps">XDSD</span>, where everyone is expendable, but I hope others won&rsquo;t borrow them into normal agile&nbsp;teams.</p>
<h2>Cultures and&nbsp;Sci-Fi</h2>
<p>Speaking of&nbsp;teams.</p>
<p>Prelude: I&rsquo;m a fan of space sci-fi series. Not a nerd, but I watched my&nbsp;share:</p>
<ul>
<li>Star Trek: <span class="caps">TOS</span> (bits), <span class="caps">TNG</span>, <span class="caps">DS9</span>, Voyager,&nbsp;Enterprise</li>
<li><span class="caps">LEXX</span></li>
<li>Battlestar Galactica (with spin-offs, except&nbsp;Caprica)</li>
<li>Firefly</li>
<li>Babylon 5 (and all&nbsp;spin-offs)</li>
<li>Farscape</li>
<li>Andromeda</li>
<li>Stargate <span class="caps">SG</span>-1 (in&nbsp;progress)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you may notice, there is no Expanse, Orville, or new Star Treks (Discovery, Short Trek). We watch only
finished stuff. I hope to avoid spoilers, but it&rsquo;s impossible with the new Star Treks. Also, I doubt I would even
want to watch them (mushroom drives? horrid&nbsp;Klingons??).</p>
<p>This week I stumbled upon a <a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnlxugk3Qb0">comparison between <span class="caps">TNG</span> and Short Trek</a>. 
How this is related to teams and culture? Well, the basic problem is the same for both series: a crew member with a quirky 
behavior who doesn&rsquo;t fit a&nbsp;team.</p>
<p><span class="caps">TNG</span> solved the problem by trying to help Lieutenant Barclay to overcome his anxiety and integrate into the team. 
While he remained awkward for the rest of the series, some of his quirks were channeled into a productive direction and
helped to save the crew numerous&nbsp;times.</p>
<p>Short Trek&rsquo;s approach was&hellip; different. Edward Larkin died and was called an idiot by his <em>&ldquo;competent&rdquo;</em> captain. 
Just watch it. The captain wanted to transfer that scientist even <em>before he made a mistake.</em> Show defenders say that 
it&rsquo;s just a comedy, but these series are not marketed as a parody show.  It&rsquo;s a canon now. Which means, 
that obnoxious and demeaning conduct of the captain is considered ok in that universe. No one reprimanded her for
causing an ecological disaster, and she never showed any remorse for the &ldquo;idiot&rsquo;s&rdquo;&nbsp;death. </p>
<p>I understand that showrunners are just money hoarders and want to have a comedy because it&rsquo;s profitable. They 
probably never consider how it affects existing&nbsp;canon. </p>
<p>Still. I wonder, what this <em>modern</em> approach tells about our&nbsp;society? </p>
