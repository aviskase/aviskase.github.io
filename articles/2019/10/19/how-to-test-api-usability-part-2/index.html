    <p>This is part two of a two-parter. Check out <a class="internal" href="https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2019/10/13/how-to-test-api-usability-part-1/">part one</a>.</p>
<h2>Empirical&nbsp;Methods</h2>
<p>The distinction between analytical and empirical methods is that the latter investigates how real users will use the&nbsp;product.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t assume that empirical methods are by default better than analytical: both are important because they discover different problems. <a class="external" href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-34347-6_10.pdf">This research</a> showed that heuristics were more efficient in finding documentation and structural problems, whereas empirical methods were more useful in finding <abbr title="User Experience"><span class="caps">UX</span></abbr> and runtime specific&nbsp;issues.</p>
<p><img alt="Barchart with comparison of different issue types found via different methods" src="https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2019/10/19/how-to-test-api-usability-part-2/api_ux_barchart.png"></p>
<h3>Monitoring</h3>
<p>Monitoring is used to gather usage statistics. For web services, it&rsquo;s rather easy. For instance, you can discover that one <span class="caps">API</span> endpoint is never called. Hence, you should consider the causes: is it missing in the documentation or not needed to anyone? Monitoring also helps to map scenarios: what kind of requests, to which services, and in what order happen most&nbsp;often.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget to monitor not only successful requests but also failures. Imagine, some business errors are stockpiling: maybe you need to reconsider <span class="caps">API</span> design or error&nbsp;handling?</p>
<p>Another thing to monitor is data volumes. Analysts from the project I worked on assumed that  type A documents should be more common than type B documents, so the service was better optimized for the first type. It was quite a surprise when we did a simple <span class="caps">SQL</span> count and found out that the number of type A documents were 600 thousand, while type B accounted for 80 million. After that discovery, we had to prioritize tasks related to service B way&nbsp;higher.</p>
<h3>Support&nbsp;Tickets</h3>
<p>If you have a support team, you&rsquo;re in luck: analyze tickets, pick out those related to usability, and identify the most serious issues. Previously I <a class="internal" href="https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2019/09/02/your-api-is-your-public-image/">wrote about accidental Cyrillic symbols instead of English in service schema</a>: these problems resurfaced specifically via&nbsp;support.</p>
<p>Moreover, support tickets offer insight into the most common tools and workflows used to work with your <span class="caps">API</span>. Once we had an external developer who generated <code>soapAction</code> dynamically based on a root request structure by trimming the word <code>Request</code>. For example, <code>importHouseRequest</code> gave <code>importHouse</code>. But one of our services with a name <code>importPaymentDocumentRequest</code> expected <code>soapAction=importPaymentDocumentData</code> instead of <code>importPaymentDocument</code> (what the developer would expect). On the one hand, the user&rsquo;s solution was poor: you&rsquo;d better use <abbr title="Web Services Description Language"><span class="caps">WSDL</span></abbr>. On the other hand, maybe they didn’t have a choice  and we probably should ask ourselves why naming wasn&rsquo;t&nbsp;consistent.</p>
<h3>Surveys</h3>
<p>Not everyone has a support service. Or perhaps it doesn&rsquo;t give enough information. In that case, surveying <span class="caps">API</span> users is helpful. There is no point in giving examples: this topic is highly contextual. But you can start with the basics: &ldquo;What do you like?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What do you don&rsquo;t like?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;What would you like to&nbsp;change?&rdquo;.</p>
<h3>User&nbsp;Sessions</h3>
<p>User sessions are the most expensive and cumbersome usability evaluation method. You need to find people based on a typical user profile, give them some tasks, watch the process, and analyze&nbsp;results.</p>
<p>Each company administers sessions in its own way. <a class="external" href="http://apiux.com/2014/06/10/usability-dropbox-api/">Some perform remote sessions</a>, <a class="external" href="http://blog.pamelafox.org/2012/03/api-usability-testing.html">others invite developers on site</a>. In both cases developers can use their own laptops and favorite IDEs: first, it&rsquo;s closer to real-world conditions, second, it minimizes stress from an unknown&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>Yet, there are more exotic examples. A developer is led to the room with a one-way mirror (yup, like in movies). A usability expert sits behind the mirror and observes developer actions as well as what&rsquo;s happening on the dev&rsquo;s computer screen. The developer can ask questions, but the expert will answer only in rare cases. In my opinion, it&rsquo;s too&nbsp;sterile.</p>
<p>Generally, all <span class="caps">API</span> related user sessions have two phases. The first phase is <strong>a developer workshop</strong> with tasks&nbsp;like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solve a problem in the notebook without an <span class="caps">IDE</span> (to get an idea of how developers would design <span class="caps">API</span> on their&nbsp;own).</li>
<li>Practical tasks for <span class="caps">API</span> usage (e.g., write a code for file upload using a&nbsp;service).</li>
<li>Read and review a code snippet to assess its clarity and readability (use printouts to make this task more&nbsp;challenging).</li>
<li>Debug a faulty code snippet (this helps to study how a user will handle and correct an&nbsp;error).</li>
</ul>
<p>The second phase is <strong>an interview</strong> where you&nbsp;ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name three biggest issues you encountered during the workshop and how did you overcome them (documentation, support, StackOverflow, a friend&rsquo;s&nbsp;help)?</li>
<li>How much time did you spend looking for additional information outside official&nbsp;documentation?</li>
<li>Did you encounter unexpected error messages? If yes, did they help you correct a&nbsp;problem?</li>
<li>Name at least three ways to improve official&nbsp;documentation.</li>
<li>Name at least three ways to improve <span class="caps">API</span>&nbsp;design.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personas</h2>
<p>Personas are used both in analytical and empirical methods. All you need is to figure out which characteristics best describe your users (in case of <span class="caps">API</span>, developers). These descriptions tend to be humanized by assigning a name and a photo, adding information about fears and preferences. You can wear a &ldquo;persona hat&rdquo; while applying heuristics or rely on them while selecting developers for user&nbsp;sessions.</p>
<p>Typical developers&rsquo;&nbsp;personas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Systematic developers</strong> don&rsquo;t trust <span class="caps">API</span> and write code defensively. They are usually deductive, write on C++, C, or even&nbsp;Assembly.</li>
<li><strong>Pragmatic developers</strong> are more common and work both in deductive and inductive manners. Typically they code desktop and mobile apps in Java or&nbsp;C#.</li>
<li><strong>Opportunistic developers</strong> concentrate on solving business problems in an exploratory and inductive fashion. Guess what language they prefer?&nbsp;JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p>Now, I want to point out that the aforementioned language discrimination is not my invention. If you&rsquo;re lucky, perhaps you&rsquo;ll find the original article by Visual Studio usability expert, where these quirky definitions were introduced. Unfortunately, I was able to get only <a class="external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190402085549/http://www.drdobbs.com/windows/measuring-api-usability/184405654">its first page in the Wayback Machine</a>, so you have to take my word for it. Nevertheless, I hope this example can encourage you to create your own&nbsp;personas. </p>
</div>
<p>We can also combine personas with cognitive dimensions. Create <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart">a radar chart</a> with 12 axes, where each axis is a cognitive dimension. Next, plot current values for your <span class="caps">API</span> and values according to the persona&rsquo;s expectations. This chart is great for comparing how existing <span class="caps">API</span> corresponds to user&nbsp;values. </p>
<p><img alt="Radar chart with comparison of developer expectations vs current state of API" src="https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2019/10/19/how-to-test-api-usability-part-2/api_ux_chart.png"></p>
<p>Developer from the example chart (blue line) prefers <span class="caps">API</span> with a high level of consistency (10) and hates writing boilerplate (4). As we can see, the current state of <span class="caps">API</span> (black line) doesn&rsquo;t satisfy these&nbsp;criteria.</p>
<h2>Summing&nbsp;Up</h2>
<p>Readers comfortable with <span class="caps">GUI</span> usability testing would say: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly the same stuff!&rdquo;. And you&rsquo;re right, there is nothing supernatural about <span class="caps">API</span> usability. Even though it&rsquo;s called an <em>application programming</em> interface, programs are yet to learn how to find other APIs and use them automatically; they still need us, meatbags. That&rsquo;s why almost everything applied for <span class="caps">GUI</span> usability evaluation is reusable for <span class="caps">API</span> with some&nbsp;adjustments.</p>
<p>Now, what about <em>the best method?</em>  None, apply them all! <a class="external" href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-34347-6_10.pdf">According to this research</a>, each method can identify unique&nbsp;issues.</p>
<p><img alt="Venn diagram showing how different methods overlap in finding different issues" src="https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2019/10/19/how-to-test-api-usability-part-2/api_ux_stats.png"></p>
<p>If you are tight on resources, I suggest using the least expensive methods: heuristics, cognitive dimensions, walkthrough, and support tickets. Even the simplest techniques can drive <span class="caps">API</span>&nbsp;improvements.</p>
<p>Someone would argue that <span class="caps">API</span> usability is not that important: &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have time for that, it&rsquo;s a dev thingy.&rdquo; But developers created <a class="external" href="https://github.com/google/styleguide">style guides</a> not just to be fancy; this serves to accelerate the achievement of shippable quality. We care about hidden code quality, therefore we need to care about externally visible code like APIs even&nbsp;more.</p>
