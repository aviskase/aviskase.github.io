Nothing wrong with that. Some companies started posting humorous content too, and, again, that&rsquo;s totally fine: I myself prefer these to dry corporate pitches. But it&rsquo;s a real shame when you see a post like this from a test agency:</p><blockquote><p>What makes you feel more powerful:</p><ul><li>Money</li><li>Status</li><li><em>Finding bugs in other people&rsquo;s code</em></li></ul></blockquote><p>It would be dishonest to say I would never find this joke amusing. I did. Probably first half a year of being a tester, less or more. And I still hear that &ldquo;achievement unlocked ding&rdquo; in my head when I find some peculiar or very critical issue.</p><p>But I most certainly don&rsquo;t feel <em>powerful.</em> Experience with software development comes with a grain of salt and a certain sadness. Each bug you discover means:</p><ul><li>there are even more unknown problems lurking somewhere</li><li>you have to bother about code correctness instead of thinking about the value</li><li>processes are leaky and if I&rsquo;m not in position to have any impact on them I&rsquo;d probably feel <em>powerless</em></li></ul><p>So, sorry, but no, that post won&rsquo;t receive a &ldquo;like&rdquo; from me. And I&rsquo;m quite angry and sad seeing such posts coming from test agency, company that shouldn&rsquo;t be promoting stereotypes about testers as those guys who are happy to &ldquo;break stuff&rdquo; and are always &ldquo;at war with devs.&rdquo; C&rsquo;mon! In the case of this particular company, I understand that it&rsquo;s most probably marketing shit which wasn&rsquo;t approved by actual testers working there. But often it happens that we, testers, either don&rsquo;t care or not vocal enough about pointing out these harmful mistakes to juniors and non-dev people.</p></article><div class=article-nav><span class=article-nav-old><a href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2019/09/02/your-api-is-your-public-image/ title="Your API is your public image"><span class=arrow>◁</span>older</a>
