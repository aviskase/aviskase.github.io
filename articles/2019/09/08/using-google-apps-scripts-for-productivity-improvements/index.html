In fact, no app I&rsquo;ve tried supports that. It&rsquo;s a shame, because there could be several use cases for that: &ldquo;spontaneous&rdquo; cleaning&amp;organizing, fun activities, ideas review.</p><p>If you are able to import tasks (for example, via email), you can check this script. The most important thing is a <code>TASKS</code> list. Each item should have <code>range_start</code> and <code>range_end</code>. For example, <code>range_start = 2</code> and <code>range_end = 9</code> mean that task will be created in ranges from two to nine days after last created date. E.g. if the last time task with this <code>id</code> was created on September 10, next task will be created sometime between September 12 and September 19.</p><p>Script ensures the task will be created at some point during this range, just make sure it&rsquo;s triggered to run daily.</p><script src=https://gist.github.com/aviskase/c986a50fd0d2a24f98302201fcdc9fd7.js></script><h2 id=create-a-task-when-new-package-release-is-available-on-pypi><a href=#create-a-task-when-new-package-release-is-available-on-pypi>Create a task when new package release is available on PyPI</a></h2><p>I have a weird project which can start only after a particular release of one python package. It&rsquo;s not very urgent, so no hurry, but I don&rsquo;t want to check for releases manually.</p><p>This script checks RSS for the package on <a href=https://libraries.io/ class=external-link>libraries.io</a> and if there is a new version available, it will send email to AM to create a task.</p><script src=https://gist.github.com/aviskase/079fda60adaa0c74e37c84089e4bb1ae.js></script><hr><p>I didn&rsquo;t go into details about how to setup these scripts, so if you have any questions, feel free to comment.</p></article><div class=article-nav><span class=article-nav-old><a href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2019/09/04/stereotype-rant/ title="Stereotype Rant"><span class=arrow>◁</span>older</a>
