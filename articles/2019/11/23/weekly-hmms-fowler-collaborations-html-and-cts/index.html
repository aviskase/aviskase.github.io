Of course, it seems a bit <em>late</em> and <em>cursory,</em> but at least now we have <em>a very respected source</em> to point to.</p><h2 id=collaborations>Collaborations</h2><h3 id=mob-programming>Mob Programming</h3><p>Finally found time to read a <a href=https://mobprogrammingguidebook.xyz/ class=external>&ldquo;Mob Programming Guidebook&rdquo; by Maaret Pyhäjärvi</a>. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure about applying it at the moment, but it looks like an interesting method for knowledge sharing facilitation.</p><p>And contributions style roles can be reused as hats in other activities:</p><ul><li>driver (intelligent input device)</li><li>sponsor (supporting others from a unique position)</li><li>nose (noticing things about the code)</li><li>navigator (translating ideas into code)</li><li>researcher (having better information available)</li><li>automationist (recognizing repetition)</li><li>conductor (enhancing others contributions)</li><li>mobber (always contributing in different ways)</li><li>rear admiral (helping designated navigator do better and learn)</li><li>archivist (improving team visibility)</li></ul><h3 id=tips-for-code-review>Tips for Code Review</h3><p>Google Testing blog is still alive and has posted a nice <a href=https://testing.googleblog.com/2019/11/code-health-respectful-reviews-useful.html class=external>short guide about being a good code reviewer</a>. The best thing is that there are not only tips for reviewers but also <em>for authors.</em> Likewise, they could and should be applied for issue reports and other communications.</p><h2 id=validation-for-email-inputs>Validation for Email Inputs</h2><p>Standards are weird. We had a tiny funny problem this week with an OpenAPI spec and a <code>format: email.</code> The context:</p><ul><li>SwaggerUI generates <code>input</code> fields, and with this format it will have <code>type=email</code>.</li><li>When I don&rsquo;t care about cross-browser stuff, I use Chrome.</li><li>Our middleware seems to validate email formats, somewhere very deep in dependencies.</li><li>We also have a custom validation.</li></ul><p>First, I checked a request with a garbage email. It failed on the middleware layer. Then I checked an email with non-ASCII characters, but our validation failed. That meant that validation in middleware was passing; therefore, its validation checks were better than ours.</p><p>The dev who worked on fixing the bug noticed an interesting behavior. If you use Firefox to open SwaggerUI, it will add a red highlighting for an email input field when a value contains non-ASCII characters. According to the <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email class=external>MDN docs</a>, this is a known problem due to <a href=https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/4562 class=external>HTML5 issue</a>. The specification proposes using a simple regex for validation!</p><p>Chrome does not complain about internationalized values. And it means that Firefox implemented HTML5 spec <em>too well,</em> introducing a confusing behavior. Oops.</p><h2 id=carpal-tunnel-syndrome>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</h2><p>I wasn&rsquo;t diagnosed with CTS (yet), but my posture at home is awful, so my right hand <em>hurts.</em> I don&rsquo;t have a proper desk and usually I sit with a laptop at a <em>round table.</em> Thus, there is not enough room to position a &ldquo;mouse&rdquo; hand.</p><p>A year ago I bought a cheap <a href=https://www.amazon.ca/Anker-Wireless-Vertical-Ergonomic-Optical/dp/B00FGI2QVC class=external>Anker vertical mouse</a>. It&rsquo;s great, even with my shitty habits I have had no pain. But it&rsquo;s wired, and soon I&rsquo;ll need a wireless one. Logitech is always my first choice in this case because it doesn&rsquo;t drain batteries too fast. Unfortunately, their only vertical mouse is unreasonably expensive, so I&rsquo;ve decided to experiment with their <a href=https://www.amazon.ca/Logitech-910-001799-M570-Wireless-Trackball/dp/B0043T7FXE/ class=external>M570 trackball</a>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s cool that you don&rsquo;t need to move your hand at all, but <em>the pain has returned:</em> it looks like vertical mouse works better for small spaces. For a trackball, you should be able to lay down your hand somewhere fully. Though, the more expensive trackball model can be vertically adjusted. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll get a real own desk soon, will see how it goes.</p><div class="page-navigation code"><a class=prev href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2019/11/16/weekly-hmms-valuations-job-titles-conferences-apis/ title="Weekly Hmms: Valuations, Job Titles, Conferences, APIs">&larr; older</a>
