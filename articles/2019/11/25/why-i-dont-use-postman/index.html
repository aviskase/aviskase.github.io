It&rsquo;s the most well-known tool for HTTP-based APIs and it&rsquo;s so ubiquitous that some use it even for SOAP (not the best idea ever).</p><p><em>I did use Postman.</em> <a href=https://gist.github.com/aviskase/e642248c35e400b56e2489430952369f class=external>My gist with installation scripts for Linux</a> was so popular that Postman support team reached me out when it started causing non-obvious issues with updates. I also used this tool for internship courses. Yet I won&rsquo;t do it anymore and let me explain why.</p><h2 id=im-not-a-tech-writer>I&rsquo;m Not a Tech Writer</h2><p>Postman isn&rsquo;t just a tool for testing: it&rsquo;s often used for writing documentation. I&rsquo;m a tester, thus, this use case does not apply to my day-to-day work. Maybe it can be useful for your organization, though I don&rsquo;t approve of the inability to self-host.</p><h2 id=im-confused-by-gui-driven-tools>I&rsquo;m Confused by GUI-Driven Tools</h2><p>I still have PTSD from SoapUI. It&rsquo;s the best exploratory testing tool for SOAP services, but, damn, scenarios more difficult than request+response are brain busters. Many people don&rsquo;t have problems with GUI-driven stuff:</p><ul><li>JMeter for load testing</li><li>UI git apps</li><li>Point&click tools for web automation</li></ul><p>For me, all these are torture devices for anything more involved than two clicks. <em>It&rsquo;s something psychological,</em> because if GUI tool requires tinkering with LEGO-like loop/if steps or pre/post-scripts, my nerve cells start audibly screeching. I&rsquo;m not a command line nerd and I use these tools for certain activities, but not for complex automation.</p><h2 id=i-can-code>I Can Code</h2><p>Here we go to the obvious part: I am comfortable with code. Yeah, shitty smelling code, nevertheless, I find it way more intuitive to write a for loop <em>purely</em> in a programming language than to glue together pieces of JavaScript with GUI-level bits.</p><p>My language of choice is Python because it&rsquo;s very easy to scribble down a working script. It also has packages for any API needs imaginable, be it <a href=https://requests.kennethreitz.org/en/master/ class=external>Requests</a>, <a href=https://github.com/Yelp/bravado class=external>Bravado</a>, <a href=https://python-zeep.readthedocs.io/en/master/ class=external>Zeep</a>, or <a href=https://github.com/yandex/yandex-tank class=external>Yandex.Tank</a>.</p><h2 id=i-use-insomnia>I Use Insomnia</h2><p>Until recently I still used Postman a bit. I switched to Insomnia for mostly emotional reasons:</p><ul><li>Insomnia is open-source.</li><li>Postman is bloated with features I don&rsquo;t need.</li><li>There is <em>too much</em> Postman around. They even organize a conference now! I wonder is there a certification somewhere already.</li></ul><p>Insomnia is a case where <em>less is more.</em> I hope its recent acquisition by a bigger company won&rsquo;t be detrimental, but being open-source we can always fork it.</p><p>Though it&rsquo;s not the only tool I use for exploratory API testing. My general patterns are:</p><ul><li>Rapid data creation or testing simple requests: curl</li><li>Requests with bigger payloads: SwaggerUI or Insomnia</li><li>Chained, looped, or other complex stuff: reusing bravado-based adapters from automation framework</li></ul><p>And for actual automation, it&rsquo;s code and code only.</p><hr><p>Your brain is your brain. Your context is your context. Mine resulted in avoiding GUI-driven tools. Research, try different approaches, and don&rsquo;t simply default to the most popular choice.</p><div class="page-navigation code"><a class=prev href=https://www.aviskase.com/articles/2019/11/23/weekly-hmms-fowler-collaborations-html-and-cts/ title="Weekly Hmms: Fowler, Collaborations, HTML, and CTS">&larr; older</a>
