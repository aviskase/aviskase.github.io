The first part is kick-ass. You can just quote a random sentence from it and it will be great.

The book has three parts: published letters, unpublished, essays.</p><p>The first part is kick-ass. You can just quote a random sentence from it and it will be great.</p><p>For instance, I really want to use this one as a personal motto:</p><blockquote><p>The only principle I&rsquo;m prepared to absolutely commit to, with absolute certainty, is that I can change my mind.</p></blockquote><p>And this one clearly shows the moment when everything starts flying to hell:</p><blockquote><p>If a person has the power to cause the project to fail, then they can say ‘testing is not required’, at the point they make the decision to doom the project.</p></blockquote><p>Oh, how often it is when a check is &ldquo;done&rdquo;, then no, not a single step back, there will be no time for restesting and rechecking:</p><blockquote><p>And as we all know, once a ‘Test Case’ is done, it can never be undone.</p></blockquote><p>Guru by themselves, so classic:</p><blockquote><p>Enumerate everything that you do, and only you do, and then define ‘true’ Exploratory Testing as the specific combination of items that you enumerated</p></blockquote><p>The second part wasn&rsquo;t so interesting. Yep, there are more practical and philosophical ideas, but they weren&rsquo;t <em>evil</em> enough. It also applies to the third part.</p><p>Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s the book you&rsquo;ll want to reread &mdash; cute devil&rsquo;s doodles and provocative style are awesome.
