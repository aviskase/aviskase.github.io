But there is another good book and it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;The &lsquo;A&rsquo; Word&rdquo;. You can buy it on <a href=https://leanpub.com/TheAWord class=external-link>LeanPub</a>.</p><p>The book is about automation in testing, but not how <em>to do</em> it &mdash; it&rsquo;s about how <em>to think</em> about it. It&rsquo;s short, just 58 pages, but very dense with ideas and Alan&rsquo;s opinions.</p><p>As I am not qualified to give an opinion on automation topics (because I don&rsquo;t have much experience with it), I&rsquo;ve just gathered some notes for future referencing. Sections are divided by chapters.</p><hr><blockquote><p>Sometimes, testers use programming skills to help their testing. Sometimes, that code automates some application functionality. That&rsquo;s it.</p></blockquote><h3 id=testing-failing-to-succeed><a href=#testing-failing-to-succeed>Testing: failing to succeed</a></h3><p>There is a very famous concept called &ldquo;Orders of Ignorance&rdquo; introduced by Phillip Glen Armour (<a href=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27293624_The_five_orders_of_ignorance class=external-link>more here</a>). Chapter&rsquo;s idea is that mostly tests are done on 0OI level, but we should never forget about 2OI test. 0OI is a lack of ignorance (I know) and 2OI is a lack of awareness (I don&rsquo;t know what I don&rsquo;t know).</p><blockquote><p>0OI tests are <em>knowledge-proving</em> tests, while 2OI tests are <em>knowledge-acquiring</em> tests.</p></blockquote><h3 id=the-robots-are-taking-over><a href=#the-robots-are-taking-over>The robots are taking over</a></h3><blockquote><p>Humans fail when they don&rsquo;t use automation to solve problems impossible or impractical for manual efforts.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Automation fails when it tries to do or verify something that&rsquo;s more suited for a human evaluation.</p></blockquote><h3 id=to-automate-><a href=#to-automate->To automate &mldr;?</a></h3><blockquote><p><em>Good</em> testers test first &mdash; or at the very least they think of tests first.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>Great</em> testers first think about how they&rsquo;re going to approach a testing problem, then figure out what&rsquo;s suitable for automation, and what&rsquo;s not suitable.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You should automate 100% of the tests that <em>should be</em> automated</p></blockquote><p>Alan&rsquo;s heuristic when to automate: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Bored&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-coding-tester><a href=#the-coding-tester>The coding tester</a></h3><p>Summary:</p><ul><li>the role of a coder-tester <em>is not</em> to automate everything</li><li>testers <em>do not</em> need to have a computer science</li><li>testers <em>do not</em> need to be able to program</li><li>programming knowledge <em>does not</em> destroy &ldquo;a proper tester angle&rdquo;</li><li>background similar to customer&rsquo;s <em>does not</em> make you a customer</li></ul><h3 id=gui-shmooey><a href=#gui-shmooey>GUI shmooey</a></h3><blockquote><p>For 95% of all software applications, directly automating the GUI is a waste of time.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>For the record, I typed 99% above first, then chickened out.</p></blockquote><h3 id=design-for-gui-automation><a href=#design-for-gui-automation>Design for GUI automation</a></h3><p>Alan&rsquo;s main points for disliking GUI automation:</p><ul><li>It&rsquo;s (typically) fragile &mdash; tests tend to break / stop working / work unsuccessfully often</li><li>It rarely lasts through multiple versions of a project (another aspect of fragility)</li><li>It&rsquo;s freakin&rsquo; hard to automate UI (and keep track of state, verify, etc.)</li><li>Available tools are weak to moderate (this is arguable, depending on what you want to do with the tools &mdash; I&rsquo;m particularly pleased, for example, with what good testers are able to do with selenium and web driver).</li></ul><blockquote><p>I love GUI automation that can automatically explore variations of a GUI based task flow.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I like GUI automation is in stress or performance issues.</p></blockquote><h3 id=its-probably-a-design-problem><a href=#its-probably-a-design-problem>It&rsquo;s (probably) a design problem</a></h3><ul><li>Record & Playback automation is a non-starter</li><li>Basic verification that would be hit by anyone walking through the basics of the application isn&rsquo;t worth automation</li><li>Tests that do exactly the same thing every time are not valuable</li><li>Always think forward</li><li>Plan for failure and ensure that all test failures tell you exactly what is wrong</li><li>Tests should be reliable</li><li>There is always a better alternative to Sleep statements</li><li>UI is fragile, its testability should designed</li></ul><h3 id=in-the-middle><a href=#in-the-middle>In the middle</a></h3><p>Alan&rsquo;s brainstorming technique: first spend a reasonable amount of time focusing on the extremes &mdash; because often, some great ideas for &ldquo;the middle&rdquo; comes out of that brainstorming.</p><h3 id=test-design-for-automation><a href=#test-design-for-automation>Test design for automation</a></h3><blockquote><p>The first step &mdash; and most important &mdash; is to think how you&rsquo;re going to test.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>From that initial test design effort, you can deduce what aspects of testing could be accomplished more efficiently with automation (and without).</p></blockquote><h3 id=orchestrating-test-automation><a href=#orchestrating-test-automation>Orchestrating test automation</a></h3><blockquote><p>Designing good tests is one of the hardest tasks in software development.</p></blockquote><h3 id=lol-----ur-automashun-suckz><a href=#lol-----ur-automashun-suckz>LOL &mdash; UR AUTOMASHUN SUCKZ!</a></h3><p>Your tests don&rsquo;t suck:</p><ul><li>when you treat their code like a production code<ul><li>core reviews</li><li>static analysis</li><li>running with the debugger to ensure they are doing what you think they are</li><li>trust: if a test fails, it&rsquo;s a product bug, not a test bug</li></ul></li><li>when they execute automatically</li><li>when failures are handled automatically<ul><li>bugs are entered automatically &mdash;
