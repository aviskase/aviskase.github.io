Title: Remember The Milk for Task Management
Date: 2018-03-20

Today I received a letter from [Remember The Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/) that I had won a free year of Pro. That's great, yet I feel a bit sad because somehow everyone talks about every other todo app and not RTM.

I've been using RTM for several years. First, with free account, later with Pro. And it's a *second* time I won a Pro :) RTM is great. For me, four killer features are:

* Start dates and due dates
* Very customizable repeat options
* Really smart add syntax (you can input everything as one-liner and all task fields will be populated)
* Smart lists (basically, it's saved searches with operators like `tag:` and logic control with `AND`/`OR`/`NOT`/parentheses)

You can implement any imaginable task management system with it. I use [a setup based on M.&nbsp;Dorofeev's approach](http://blog.rememberthemilk.com/post/172085635648/tips-tricks-tuesday-combining-organization).  Of course, specialized apps are probably a bit easier if you strictly follow rules of one "true" system, but with RTM you can do the heck you want any time you want. There is a bizarre development fashion to "box" users with constraints, to give no options. And for me RTM is a breeze of sane air of freedom.
