## Advent of code
Last week I forgot to mention that I started solving the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. This is my first year, so I don't even try to have elegant solutions. Old trusty Python, [lists' and dicts' galore](https://github.com/aviskase/advent-of-code).

The reason is simple: the goal is to go through all 25 days. Being consistent is not easy, and today I had to solve two days because of yesterday's Christmas party.

## NGINX

[The news about police raids in NGINX office](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2019/12/13/what-s-yours-is-ours) is at the same time surprising and not. Before there were VKontakte and Euroset; for some reason being honestly successful is not allowed in Russia.

## APIs

[Tom Johnson released a podcast with Arnaud Lauret](https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/api-design-usability-arnaud-lauret-podcast/). Even though it's a tech writing perspective, I strongly recommend testers to check it out. Laments about not being able to influence design are fun to hear: it's almost like Agile, DevOps, WhatNotOps missed out tech writers.

Also, I found two interesting API related newsletters: ["API Developer Weekly"](https://apideveloperweekly.com/) and["Net API Notes"](https://tinyletter.com/NetAPINotes/archive). If you look at the signup page for the first one, I bet you will notice that it doesn't mention testers. I wonder, is it because their team follows MT-like approach and includes testers into dev set? Hope so.
