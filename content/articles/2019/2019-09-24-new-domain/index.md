Yay, I've bought my own domain! 

First I though about fancy-schmancy `.me` or `.io`. Or maybe `aviska.se`. But I went with simple aviskase.com. Not that I am particularly invested into SEO and stuff, but all the articles recommend to be boring. Also, I used _comparable products_ heuristic: most of the blogs I am subscribed to have the same dull TLD.

BTW, if anyone ever was subscribed to RSS, sorry for whole new regeneration =(
