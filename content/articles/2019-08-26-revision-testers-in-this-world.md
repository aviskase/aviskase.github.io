Title: Revision: Testers in This World

Recently I've remembered [my old article]({filename}/articles/2018-01-23-en-testers-in-this-world.md) and wondered, how much my thoughts  have changed and how they align to the principles of context-driven and modern testing (and yes, I don't see them as contradicting each other).

!!! update ""
    Remark is the parentheses is a bit stupid. It was discussed in the [AB Testing episode 94](https://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/ab-testing-episode-94-modern-testing-meets-context-driven-testing/) and at least for Alan and Brent there is no real contradiction.

It looks like there are two main themes in that article.

## Theme One: Finding a Job as a Tester

A bit of a background: when I was writing that piece, I was in depression. That's a different story about development culture and its effect on one's mind, but I'll write about it sometime later. So, depression. And a bit of worrying about getting the first job locally in Canada.

No wonder that rereading the article now feel like the main takeaway was "software development is a shitty business, whatever progress will be made, there will be still more than enough companies to hire testers." And I won't argue *the last part.* Modern testing principles are things to strive for, but my experience so far tells me that it's too optimistic to assume that *all* companies will end up there. So, there will be enough companies who will lag behind. Ergo, there will be enough positions for *any* testers. Even for mindless test case executors. 

Now, the question is, do I *want* to work in such companies? **No.**

If I would want to continue as a tester-generalist, without specializing in some future-proof niches like pentest or perftest (at least, they seem to be future-proof), a sweet spot would be companies closer on a way to the "tester-less" transformation, but still needing some help on that way. Will there be enough such companies? Probably, yes. Getting position will be definitely harder but not impossible.


## Theme Two: Clay Metaphor

Nowadays I agree even more with the metaphor I came up with in that article. Yes, we are a clay or a sealing foam. We, testers, should help others in improving quality. That means that our work is immensely context-dependent: different organizations need different "holes" to seal. 

But we can go on even further with this metaphor: make it's not just a clay, but a sci-fi fancy-shmancy clay which heals holes and scabs when applied. Yup, that means that after some time we won't be needed in this organization; that's fine. You can move to some other position where your experience being adaptable and generalizing could be of assistance. Or you can find other organization and kill testing position there too. 

---

As a result, while some wording was off, core principles still sound ok to me: adapt, help&heal, move on.
