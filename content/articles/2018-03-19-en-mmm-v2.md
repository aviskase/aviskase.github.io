Title: Mega Mind Map: Version #2
Date: 2018-03-19


My [not-so-mega mind map](https://github.com/aviskase/mega-mind-map) has grown a little bit. I finally added exploratory testing tours and ideas on how to make test cases less rigid, all that great stuff from "Exploratory Software Testing" by James A. Whittaker.
