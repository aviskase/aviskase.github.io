Just a quick note: I've switched to Pelican site generator, because ruby-shuby decided not to work. Unfortunately, switching and preserving multi-language support is cumbersome. So, I've decided to ditch RU version. For what it's worth, I moved to Canada and no longer really interested in trying to "promote" myself in Russian speaking communities.

Yeah, yeah, "promote", --- written by a person who hasn't write *anything* for ages. Right.

Whoever read this blog in Russian, sorry. And, actually, I know that there were more traffic from CIS than from any other region >< But, two languages makes it too complicated and procrastinating to write in consistent manner *(hysterical laugh).* 

Зыс ис зе энд.
