Today I'd like to share [this bit about my great-grand father Bagriy Ivan](http://www.zbarazh-library.com.ua/writen/history/UPA.pdf):

> The last bunker in our region was destroyed by the NKVD in 1952 in the Lubianets forest.
> Four shylyans were killed then:
> 
> - Antoniuk Volodymyr - born in 1923.
> - Bagriy Ivan - born in 1911.
> - Voznyi Ivan - born in 1905.
> - Hulovskyi Vasyl - born in 1918.


Nineteen fifty-two. By that time, Ivan's wife and son (my grandfather) had already been exiled to Kazakhstan.

One can write a lengthy eloquent essay about never surrendering, believing in independence, and so on. I won't.

Слава Україні. Героям слава.
