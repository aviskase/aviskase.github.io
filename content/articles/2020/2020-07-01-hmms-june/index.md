Time for the list of things I found interesting/amusing this month. 

## Link Soup

Let's start with the good news: [OpenAPI 3.1.0 RC is out!](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2020/06/18/openapi-3-1-0-rc0-its-here). Webhooks and reconciliation with JSON Schema are the highlights of the version. I hope tooling support won't lag this time.

I really liked [the article by Daniel Jarjoura](https://techleadership.substack.com/p/chance-meetings-asynchronous-collaboration) on communications. For example, I didn't know that crowd brainstorming is proved to be less effective. 


Cool little apps I was recommended:

- For drawing: [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)
- For text expansion: [Espanso](https://espanso.org/)
- For knowledge management: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (more about it in the next article)


## Positioning Change

And, finally, the regular column "I kinda don't like testers." This month I tracked all testers-centric communities and articles to determine how useful these sources of information are for me. The result was as expected: noise to signal ratio was appalling. I'm tired of:

- Rehashing of the same ideas _by the same authors_ for years.
- Questions that will never pass [Stack Overflow filter](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).
- "Should testers learn to code?" debate specifically.
- Being overly dramatic about the slightest differences in opinion. The schools of testing, yadda-yadda.
- Over-glorifying the tester's role and knowledge (common in certain groups).
- Jokes and memes about us (testers) vs. them (devs) (typical amongst juniors and junior oriented resources).

Thus, I made some decision:

**1.** I left RST and MoT (and [its abolished sister group](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/news/ministry-of-testing-slacks-when-two-become-one)) slack communities. Stayed only in the ABT, because it's smaller and more enjoyable.

**2.** Won't hunt for any more testers-centric resources. Mind you, testers-centric â‰  testing-centric. Whatever I had in RSS + ABT podcast is more than enough.

**3.** Won't save articles into reading queue "just in case", if it's obvious from the title and the first paragraph that the author is repeating themselves.

**4.** Change "About me" page to be less role specific. I wrote it a long time ago. 

**5.** Do I contribute to the same noise? Perhaps. Can't promise, but I'll try not to. Obviously, these _Hmms_ aren't really original content, but [written reflection is a great way to process information](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/reading-note-taking-writing/), sorry!

## P.S. The Saddest YouTube's Recommendation

YouTube recommended me to rewatch [the opening sequence to the "Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6oTziHKM_c). The movie is forgettable, but this small part is a masterful tearjerker, _especially now._
