This month's hmms were supposed to be easy peasy to do: just grab all new notes created in Obsidian, curate a bit, and, voilà, done. I even wrote [a small python tool](https://pypi.org/project/obsidian-progress-report/).
 
Yeah, right. I keep forgetting that it's almost impossible to get file's *creation date* on Linux. There is [a hacky way](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/131347) for ext4, but in my case it didn't work: according to the script, almost all notes were created on Aug 18 o_O. Ok, lesson learned, now my notes will have yaml front matter with creation date =(

After sifting through files manually, looks like these were the resources that grabbed my attention the most:


- Several articles by Marty Cagan:
  - ["Missionaries vs. Mercenaries"](https://svpg.com/missionaries-vs-mercenaries/)
  - ["Product vs. Feature Teams"](https://svpg.com/product-vs-feature-teams/)
  - ["Product Team FAQ"](https://svpg.com/product-team-faq/)
  - ["The Four Big Risks"](https://svpg.com/four-big-risks/)
  - ["Team Objectives – Overview"](https://svpg.com/team-objectives-overview/)
- ["Estimates Anchor Expectations; Forecasts Include Uncertainty"](https://www.jrothman.com/mpd/2020/07/estimates-anchor-expectations-forecasts-include-uncertainty/) by Johanna Rothman hits right! Don't like being language police, but some words do hinder understanding.
- ["Design Docs at Google"](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/) by Malte Ubl
- ["What is your API IQ?"](https://pkglobal.com/blog/2020/06/api-interface-quadrant/) by Lou Powell

- ["Is Betteridge's law of headlines correct?"](http://calmerthanyouare.org/2015/03/19/betteridges-law.html) by Mats Linander. Just one more example of "rule of thumb" being incorrect. 

- [Andy Matuschak's livestream of his note-writing session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGcs4tyey18). This is for hardcore people. You know the meme with one big doggo and one smol doggo? Well, I felt quite smol watching Andy's thought process. *So deep*.
- Have you seen [Maggie Appleton' blog](https://maggieappleton.com/)? She is an awesome illustrator, but she also started publishing articles in the form of "digital garden". Looks like it's becoming [a trend](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/what-is-a-digital-garden).
