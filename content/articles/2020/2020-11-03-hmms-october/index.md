Monthly collection of things that got me ~~thinking~~ _hmming_.

## Links lunch

- I was reading ["Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches"](https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html) (which in itself is a great piece) when I saw 
[MediaWiki's discussion about moving to GitLab](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/GitLab_consultation#Outcome). Guess what, they used Fowler's article as a basis for definitions in the discussion. It's curious how some persons' outputs instantly become almost a "standard."
- Uncle Bob [explained SOLID yet again](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2020/10/18/Solid-Relevance.html). What got my attention was how _simple_ was his explanation.
- No, I didn't switch to [JuliaMono font](https://cormullion.github.io/pages/2020-07-26-JuliaMono/), but please check it out if you need a font with an enormous range of characters.
- And take a look at draft for extending [HTTP `SEARCH` method's semantics](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-snell-search-method-02). Perhaps, one day we will forget about `GET` and `POST` queries?
- This tweet perfectly captures [my feelings about new Google redesign](https://twitter.com/fredericl/status/1320764737576030215).

## No-code API platforms
One of the recurring theme in the API domain is [low-- and no-code API solutions](https://increment.com/apis/how-low-code-api-integrations/), so-called *democratization of APIs*. Common examples are [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/). 

Yesterday I stumbled upon this video by Curtis McHale:

It shows a very specific productivity workflow for iOS, but the curious thing is how much of it is automated by glueing together different apps via [shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios). More eloquent writer could conjure the whole essay, but my thoughts so far are:

- I, "lots-of-code" person, wouldn't come up with such workflow. My routine automation tend to be one-to-one connections, whereas presented shortcut covers many apps.
- UI-based automation mechanisms are limited but provide inspiration via affordances ([see also](https://medium.com/swlh/for-a-more-creative-brain-embrace-constraints-5a588c8a8619)).
- Having a native OS mechanism enables the widest possible audience. 
- Services with apps shouldn't limit integration capabilities only to web APIs; custom URL schemes are perfect for local app-to-app interactions.



## Hi, YouTube 

One day, as we were talking about our [knowledge management systems]({{< ref 2020-07-03-knowledge-management-tools >}}) in the [Obsidian discord's](https://obsidian.md/community) #russian channel, I decided to record a video to show mine.

It's in Russian and it's bad xD

Jeez, _this was hard_. Rerecording, cleaning up, cutting bits, and constantly, constantly hearing yourself in the process. And I didn't even try to do anything fancy, just plain screen cast with editing out all the "eeeehm". I'll probably have to do the same in English, and the very thought terrifies me: it was painful enough to hear me speak in my native language. Guess how horrible will be that with the accent.
