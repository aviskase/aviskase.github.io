It's March already, time to summarize February!

## APIs Trainings

I did a small company-wide training about APIs. Here is [the main deck](https://github.com/aviskase/trucs/blob/master/api101.pdf)
and [supplementary deck](https://github.com/aviskase/trucs/blob/master/api_salad.pdf) left from dev lunch&learn. 
Anyone is free to use it and if you have questions just ping me somewhere. They don't have notes, so can be pretty
cryptic, but I am inclined to continue improving them to use for new hires. 

The most important feedback was from members of marketing and tech writing teams. I failed to properly address "why's"
and they felt a bit lost. Which is a great reminder that by being constantly in the "dev soup," you falsely assume that everyone
understands how immense APIs' power and impact are.


## Readings

[Government of Canada published standards on APIs](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/modern-emerging-technologies/government-canada-standards-apis.html).
Not perfect, but it's great to see not only corporates showing their development practices but also the public sector.

Curity suggested a simple ["API security maturity model](https://curity.io/resources/architect/api-security/the-api-security-maturity-model/).
All models are wrong, but some are useful, including this one.

While ["Why we need to get rid of thought leaders"](https://www.a-sisyphean-task.com/2020/01/why-we-need-to-get-rid-of-thought.html?goal=0_02cca1920b-49fb91397f-289479173&mc_cid=49fb91397f&mc_eid=8933fe8877)
article by Adam Knight makes interesting points, I actually hoped it to cover "the leaders" problem. And this segues us
to the next section...

## Leaders and Their Followers

Perhaps I'm stating the obvious fact, but here it is: do not ever assume that appreciating content created
by the person correlates with wanting to be/stay a part of their community. Because true meanings are shown in 
[the interactions between the leader and the followers](https://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement/transcript?language=en).

As I still have respect and hope for innovations from those people, I will keep it general. There are two communities,
both sparkled by well-known persons. I was eager to join both and quickly enough found them almost at odds. And 
while one is chill and mildly sarcastic about it, the other keeps being almost aggressive. The biggest
problem with the second community _for me_ is that the most vocal followers act as non-debatable intellectuals 
who paint everything in absolutes and this behavior is _supported by their leaders._  Well. You never know until you
dive in.
