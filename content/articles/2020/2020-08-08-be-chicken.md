[The article on API change culture](https://www.apiscene.io/lifecycle/changing-culture-how-committed-are-you/) uses a well-known "the chicken and the pig" fable as an inspiration:

> A Pig and a Chicken are walking down the road.
> 
> The Chicken says: "Hey Pig, I was thinking we should open a restaurant!"
> 
> Pig replies: "Hm, maybe, what would we call it?"
> 
> The Chicken responds: "How about 'ham-n-eggs'?"
> 
> The Pig thinks for a moment and says: "No thanks. I'd be committed, but you'd only be involved."


I bet I won't say anything new or profound, but it always weirds me out that the pig is considered somewhat more important than the chicken. Oh, right, because _it must die_ to be useful.

Well, I grew up in the 90s in Kazakhstan. Like many people we were relying on our village relatives for food, so ham and egg production is not an elegant metaphor but a real-life experience for me. 

Growing pigs is a *slow process* with a big *one-time payoff*. It's not free: you need to feed them and clean the place.  And you'd better have a pair of pigs so that the production could be at least somewhat renewable. One committed pig is a splendid feast in the short term and hunger in the long term. Don't forget an emotional cost: pigs don't die by themselves. You will hear it. You will *smell* it.

Chicken produces eggs *continuously*. You don't even need a rooster. Feeding is less involved, and you can practice a free-run approach to optimize costs. With a rooster, eggs can be fertilized, and production can grow even more.

Thus, in my opinion, **chicken-style contributors are better for a project**. They bring *sustainability*. They create small ~~eggs~~  incremental improvements. They are the force of kaizen.

Whereas pigs are one-time Big Bang doers. An external contractor who came in, said you need to redo the entire workflow, got their paycheck, and left. That new employee who said: "let's rewrite the system from scratch!". Don't get me wrong, sometimes big changes are healthy and bring value, but they are also riskier. You need to have a bunch of chickens to support the process. 

Another possible consequence for pigs is burnout. You did something big and you can't do anything else anymore. Oops. 

I often gravitate towards pig's tendencies since it's easier. It's also better for CV and performance evaluations, isn't it? ;) But in the end, as some say: we prefer being generalists; the same way I'd say: let's be chickens who oink occasionally.
