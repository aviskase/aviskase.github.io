Mastodon feed for *#emacs* tag brought to my attention that there is a blog carnival going on with a prompt being [Writing experience](https://gregnewman.io/blog/emacs-carnival-2025-07-writing-experience/). 

Impostor syndrome kicks in hard, nevertheless, I'd like to use this opportunity to admit that I gave up and now use the org-mode (even though [just in May I was saying nope](https://infosec.exchange/@aviskase/114569892013739109)). 

Let's start from the beginning. I'm a tech person. I knew about Emacs. But I had never tried it. It has a kind of mythical aura around it, something you'd feel intimidated to touch. So I didn't.

I am also well aware of the editor wars with vim. This one I use sometimes. You don't really have a choice. Lots of people praise it so much and use vim bindings everywhere else. Thus, I made several attempts at learning more than just a couple of keys, yet it never stuck with me. Bleh.

A month ago, I had to decide which subscription services to continue using. And painfully, I chose not to renew [Amazing Marvin](https://amazingmarvin.com/). I love it! I wish all the best to the team (Christina, Mark, Branko); you're great people doing impressive work. But I needed to go. First, I checked the usual alternatives: Remember The Milk, TickTick, Todoist. Nope, nope, and meh. 

So, I continued my research. Obscure services, self-hosted options. While nap trapped, I stumbled upon [Orgzly](https://www.orgzlyrevived.com/) in f-droid and learned that it supports:
- different task states: TODO, NEXT, BLOCKED, DONE, CANCELLED, whatever you desire
- separate schedule and due dates
- *three* repeating patterns: every, after, catch-up (the best pattern ever)
- nested tasks / projects
- pretty good filtering (though not perfect)

Huh. This was exactly what I needed. So, I thought, OK, let's try the legendary org-mode. 

Fast forward two weeks, and I'm writing this post to say how thrilled I am. Emacs is surprisingly noob user friendly. I am not forced to be a keyboard warrior when I just want to sit back and poke with my mouse. Or I'm nap trapped. 

And when I want to use a keyboard fully, it feels like spell-casting. I'm mesmerized by Emacs magic incantations. Some say that all the Ctrl's, Meta's, and Shift's are annoying, whereas I find them natural and flowing compared to jumping back and forth between vim modes.

I've just started. My config is almost empty: I follow [Mastering Emacs](https://www.masteringemacs.org/) advice to learn the vanilla thing first. And there are of course some frustrations:
- The documentation is extensive, yet some parts require deep reading to understand. Skimming through doesn't work (me struggling with [version control docs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Version-Control.html); [magit docs](https://magit.vc/) aren't better).
- Haven't got to this yet, but I write in Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Apparently, it's preferable to use Emacs internal language control instead of the system's one. So I'll have to rework my hand memory and [research good configs](https://github.com/dunmaksim/emacs-russian-techwriter-input-method).
- Windows and buffers are unpredictable on the surface. In what window a help or a vc buffer appears still surprises me, which is annoying.
- So. Much. To. Learn. It's a blessing and a curse, I need to make a conscious decision not to chase yet another shiny feature to actually finish the tasks at hand.


Emacs is a big brain and time investment. I'm amazed enough to pursue it, yet I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. For now, I'll continue using Obsidian for PKM because the mobile app is just easier. There is an Emacs for Android and [Orgro](https://orgro.org/), alas, they can't compete. I recall [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) supporting org files, but AFAIK it was too restrictive with the structure and I didn't like the overall UX. Also [Karl Voit mentions org support is gonna go anyway](https://karl-voit.at/2024/01/28/logseq-from-org-pov/).

So, at the moment I mostly use org-mode as a task manager and a calendar. And I use Emacs for my [cooklang](https://cooklang.org/) recipe collection. It ain't much, but it's an honest start, right? :)
