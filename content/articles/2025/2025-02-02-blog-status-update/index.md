I needed to add a separate section on the blog for CTF writeups and couldn't help rewamping a bunch of things:

- Dark mode redesign inspired by [monospace web](https://owickstrom.github.io/the-monospace-web/) and [Johnny.Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/)
    - Still need to iron out the color scheme and add a light option.
    - Also ditched all the Tailwind stuff. Back to basic CSS.
- Added categories. They are kinda like broad tags where some posts can have several categories assigned. Current selection is:
    - IT: everything IT / computer science / digital related.
    - Kaleidoscope: basically "other". Non-IT topics like productivity, PKM, and general blah-blah. I might as well embrace "just post everything" approach like [Curtis McHale](https://curtismchale.ca/).
    - Writeups: for CTF writeups, duh. 
- Each category generates its own RSS feed for those who don't want to get all the content. 

That's it. Next posts will be my first writeups.
