Last year the feeling was of a quiet annoyance: "we stand together" was all about _standing_, not _winning_. This year, well, I'm pissed. Angry, osti de calisse de tabarnak. 

It's a truly marvelous sight to witness, the death of the empire. Not the best time for that, though. 

Ukraine will win, of course. That's just [how it works](../../2024/2024-02-23-two-ten-years-of-february/index.md). Alas, it would be preferable not to loose so many and so much.

As, for, unexpectedly, Canada, I'm less optimistic. How ironic that I moved from Northern Kazakhstan bordering crazy annexation-hungry country to Canada... also bordering crazy annexation-hungry country.
