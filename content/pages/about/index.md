Hi, I'm Yuliya Bagriy. Yeah, too many y's, but that's an official transliteration from Russian; if you have trouble spelling it without mistakes, so do I =) My nickname is **aviskase**, and you can find me nearly everywhere using it, for example, on [mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@aviskase).

My interests vary:

- IT stuff, including, but not limited to:
    - cybersecurity
    - APIs
    - testing
    - development in general
    - consumer-oriented Linux 
- system and process control/management/improvement 
- math and statistics in particular
- genetics
- linguistics and language learning
- science fiction   

Important disclaimer: this blog **is not obscenity-free.** [English is not my first language, thus,](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081225) expect _occasional_ fucks and tabarnaks  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯


## P.S.
If you notice any problems (there are probably hundreds of errors), just write me [an email](mailto:aviskase@gmail.com) or open an issue [on the blog's repo](https://github.com/aviskase/aviskase.github.io/issues).
