Slug: about

My name is Yuliya. Just Yuliya. But in our old internet I'm better known as **aviskase.** By that nickname you can find me nearly everywhere. And my surname is badass: Bagriy. You can pronounce it as "Bug-ray". Yay!

I am a tester. Not a QA, not a "test engineer", just a plain tester. It can be defined more specific as *a software tester*, but, metaphorically speaking, I like testing because this process and/or way of thinking can be applied to anything: hardware, concepts, social dynamics. Veni, vidi, probavi. 

## P.S.
If you notice some problems here (there are probably hundreds of mistakes), just write me [a email](mailto:aviskase@gmail.com) or open an issue [on the blog's repo](https://github.com/aviskase/aviskase.github.io/issues).
