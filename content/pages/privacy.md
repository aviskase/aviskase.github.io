Title: Privacy and Cookies

This site uses cookies for analytics and comments. You can read [more about cookies here](https://www.cookiesandyou.com).

## Google Analytics
I made sure that IP anonymization and data retention are turned on. Demographics and other marketing features are turned off.

You can revoke your consent using a consent dialog (black button in the page bottom). Don't forget to clean cookies beforehand.

## Disqus Comments

While Disqus is not that awesome in case of privacy, I've decided to stay with it instead of static comment systems. The reason is that I'm incompetent in storing user data myself. 

According to [the official post on GDPR compliance](https://blog.disqus.com/update-on-privacy-and-gdpr-compliance), Disqus manages user consent by itself.
